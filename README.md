## Usage and Installation

In order to participate in the course and to use the course material, you need to 

1. install `R`: download for free at [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org)
1. install the `RStudio` IDE at [RStudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
1. We recommend to use our code **exclusively via `RStudio`**.
1. install **this** `R` package in your computer. To do so, just copy and paste those lines into your `RStudio` console:

```R
if (!require(devtools)) {install.packages("devtools"); library(devtools)}
install_github(repo = "ScPoEcon/ScPoEconometrics")
```

### Shiny Apps

A key part of this course are a series of interactive applications (or *apps*) that we developed with the `shiny` framework. You launch the apps from a running `R` session on your computer. The app will run in your web browser. You launch an app like this from `R`:

```R
library(ScPoEconometrics)   # load our library
launchApp('SSR_cone')       # runs the `SSR_cone` app in browser

launchApp()                 # no arg produces an error that shows all available apps
Error: Please run `launchApp()` with a valid app as an argument.
Valid apps are: 'anscombe', 'confidence_intervals', 'corr_continuous', 
'datasaurus', 'reg_constrained', 'reg_dummy', 'reg_dummy_example', 
'reg_full', 'reg_multivariate', 'reg_simple', 'reg_standardized', 
'sampling', 'SSR_cone', 'standard_errors_changeN', 'standard_errors_simple'
```

Here is a screenshot of the `SSR_cone` app:

### Tutorials

In order to run the accompanying tutorials you would type, for example:

```R
library(ScPoEconometrics)
runTutorial("chapter3")
```

1. clone your fork to your computer: `git clone url_of_your_fork`
1. Start to work on your things on a new branch: `git checkout -b new_branch`
1. **commit** your work to that new branch! 
1. Place your new stuff on top of the most recent `upstream/master`:
	1. add the upstream repo as a remote: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:ScPoEcon/ScPoEconometrics.git`
	1. Use the `rebase` command
    ```
    # git add your stuff
    # git commit your stuff
    git fetch upstream   # get stuff from upstream
    git rebase upstream/master  # merge upstream master and put your commits on top of it
    ```
