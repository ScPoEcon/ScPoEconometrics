On this page we outline the course and present the Syllabus. 2018/2019 is the first time this course will be taught, so we are still in a beta release stage - you should expect a couple of loose ends here and there, but we think the overall experience is going to be pleasant! Objective This course aims to teach you the basics of data analysis needed in a Social Sciences oriented University like SciencesPo. We purposefully start at a level that assumes no prior knowledge about statistics whatsoever. Our objective is to have you understand and be able to interpret linear regression analysis. We will not rely on maths and statistics, but practical learning in order to teach the main concepts. Syllabus and Requirements You can find the topics we want to go over in the left panel of this page. The later chapters are optional and depend on the speed with which we will proceed eventually. Chapters 1-4 are the core material of the course. The only requirement is that you bring your own personal computer to each session. We will be using the free statistical computing language R very intensively. Before coming to the first session, please install R and RStudio as explained at the beginning of chapter 1. Course Structure This course is taught in several different groups across various campuses of SciencesPo. All groups will go over the same material, do the same exercises, and will have the same assessments. Groups meet once per week for 2 hours. The main purpose of the weekly meetings is to clarify any questions, and to work together through tutorials. The little theory we need will be covered in this book, and you are expected to read through this in your own time before coming to class. This Book and Other Material What you are looking at is an online textbook. You can therefore look at it in your browser (as you are doing just now), on your mobile phone or tablet, but you can also download it as a pdf file or as an epub file for your ebook-reader. We don’t have any ambition to actually produce and publish a book for now, so you should just see this as a way to disseminate our lecture notes to you. The second part of course material next to the book is an extensive suite of tutorials and interactive demonstrations, which are all contained in the R package that builds this book (and which you installed by issuing the above commands). Open Source The book and all other content for this course are hosted under an open source license on github. You can contribute to the book by just clicking on the appropriate edit symbol in the top bar of this page. Other teachers who want to use our material can freely do so, observing the terms of the license on the github repository. Assessments We will assess participation in class and conduct a final exam. Communication We will communicate exclusively on our slack group. You will get an invitation email to join from your instructor in due course. "],

To get started, you will need to install two pieces of software: R, the actual programming language. Chose your operating system, and select the most recent version. RStudio, an excellent IDE for working with R. Note, you must have R installed to use RStudio. RStudio is simply an interface used to interact with R. The popularity of R is on the rise, and everyday it becomes a better tool for statistical analysis. It even generated this book! The following few chapters will serve as a whirlwind introduction to R. They are by no means meant to be a complete reference for the R language, but simply an introduction to the basics that we will need along the way. Several of the more important topics will be re-stressed as they are actually needed for analyses. This introductory R chapter may feel like an overwhelming amount of information. You are not expected to pick up everything the first time through. You should try all of the code from this chapter, then return to it a number of times as you return to the concepts when performing analyses. We only present the most basic aspects of R. If you want to know more, there are countless online tutorials, and you could start with the official CRAN sample session or have a look at the resources at Rstudio or on this github repo. 1.2 Starting R and RStudio A key difference for you to understand is the one between R, the actual programming language, and RStudio, a popular interface to R which allows you to work efficiently and with greater ease with R. The best way to appreciate the value of RStudio is to start using R without RStudio. To do this, double-click on the R GUI that you should have downloaded on your computer following the steps above (on windows or Mac), or start R in your terminal (on Linux or Mac) by just typing R in a terminal, see figure ??. You’ve just opened the R console which allows you to start typing code right after the &gt; sign, called prompt. Try typing 2 + 2 or print(&quot;Your Name&quot;) and hit the return key. And voilà, your first R commands! Figure 1.1: R GUI symbol and R in a MacOS Terminal Figure 1.2: R GUI symbol and R in a MacOS Terminal Typing one command after the other into the console is not very convenient as our analysis becomes more involved. Ideally, we would like to collect all command statements in a file and run them one after the other, automatically. We can do this by writing so-called script files or just scripts, i.e. simple text files with extension .R or .r which can be inserted (or sourced) into an R session. RStudio makes this process very easy. Open RStudio by clicking on the RStudio application on your computer, and notice how different the whole environment is from the basic R console – in fact, that very same R console is running in your bottom left panel. The upper-left panel is a space for you to write scripts – that is to say many lines of codes which you can run when you choose to. To run a single line of code, simply highlight it and hit Command + Return. We highly recommend that you use RStudio for everything related to this course (in particular, to launch our apps and tutorials). RStudio has a large number of useful keyboard shortcuts. A list of these can be found using a keyboard shortcut – the keyboard shortcut to rule them all: On Windows: Alt + Shift + K On Mac: Option + Shift + K The RStudio team has developed a number of “cheatsheets” for working with both R and RStudio. This particular cheatseet for Base R will summarize many of the concepts in this document.1 1.2.1 First Glossary R: a statistical programming language RStudio: an integrated development environment (IDE) to work with R command: user input (text or numbers) that R understands. script: a list of commands collected in a text file, each separated by a new line, to be run one after the other. 1.3 Basic Calculations To get started, we’ll use R like a simple calculator. Run the following code either directly from your RStudio console, or in RStudio by writting them in a script and running them using Command + Return. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division Math R code Result \\(3 + 2\\) 3 + 2 5 \\(3 - 2\\) 3 - 2 1 \\(3 \\cdot2\\) 3 * 2 6 \\(3 / 2\\) 3 / 2 1.5 Exponents Math R code Result \\(3^2\\) 3 ^ 2 9 \\(2^{(-3)}\\) 2 ^ (-3) 0.125 \\(100^{1/2}\\) 100 ^ (1 / 2) 10 \\(\\sqrt{100}\\) sqrt(100) 10 Mathematical Constants Math R code Result \\(\\pi\\) pi 3.1415927 \\(e\\) exp(1) 2.7182818 Logarithms Note that we will use \\(\\ln\\) and \\(\\log\\) interchangeably to mean the natural logarithm. There is no ln() in R, instead it uses log() to mean the natural logarithm. Math R code Result \\(\\log(e)\\) log(exp(1)) 1 \\(\\log_{10}(1000)\\) log10(1000) 3 \\(\\log_{2}(8)\\) log2(8) 3 \\(\\log_{4}(16)\\) log(16, base = 4) 2 Trigonometry Math R code Result \\(\\sin(\\pi / 2)\\) sin(pi / 2) 1 \\(\\cos(0)\\) cos(0) 1 1.4 Getting Help In using R as a calculator, we have seen a number of functions: sqrt(), exp(), log() and sin(). To get documentation about a function in R, simply put a question mark in front of the function name, or call the function help(function) and RStudio will display the documentation, for example: ?log ?sin ?paste ?lm help(lm) # help() is equivalent help(ggplot,package=&quot;ggplot2&quot;) # show help from a certain package Frequently one of the most difficult things to do when learning R is asking for help. First, you need to decide to ask for help, then you need to know how to ask for help. Your very first line of defense should be to Google your error message or a short description of your issue. (The ability to solve problems using this method is quickly becoming an extremely valuable skill.) If that fails, and it eventually will, you should ask for help. There are a number of things you should include when contacting an instructor, or posting to a help website such as Stack Overflow. Describe what you expect the code to do. State the end goal you are trying to achieve. (Sometimes what you expect the code to do, is not what you want to actually do.) Provide the full text of any errors you have received. Provide enough code to recreate the error. Often for the purpose of this course, you could simply post your entire .R script or .Rmd to slack. Sometimes it is also helpful to include a screenshot of your entire RStudio window when the error occurs. If you follow these steps, you will get your issue resolved much quicker, and possibly learn more in the process. Do not be discouraged by running into errors and difficulties when learning R. (Or any other technical skill.) It is simply part of the learning process. 1.5 Installing Packages R comes with a number of built-in functions and datasets, but one of the main strengths of R as an open-source project is its package system. Packages add additional functions and data. Frequently if you want to do something in R, and it is not available by default, there is a good chance that there is a package that will fulfill your needs. To install a package, use the install.packages() function. Think of this as buying a recipe book from the store, bringing it home, and putting it on your shelf (i.e. into your library): install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Once a package is installed, it must be loaded into your current R session before being used. Think of this as taking the book off of the shelf and opening it up to read. library(ggplot2) Once you close R, all the packages are closed and put back on the imaginary shelf. The next time you open R, you do not have to install the package again, but you do have to load any packages you intend to use by invoking library(). 1.6 Code vs Output in this Book A quick note on styling choices in this book. We had to make a decision how to visually separate R code and resulting output in this book. We decided to prefix all output lines with #OUT&gt; to make the distinction. A typical code snippet with output is thus going to look like this: 1 + 3 #OUT&gt; [1] 4 # everything after a # is a comment, i.e. R disregards it. where you see on the first line the R code, and on the second line the output. As mentioned, that line starts with #OUT&gt; to say this is an output, followed by [1] (indicating this is a vector of length one - more on this below!), followed by the actual result - 1 + 3 = 4! Notice that you can simply copy and paste all the code you see into your R console. In fact, you are strongly encouraged to actually do this and try out all the code you see in this book. Finally, please note that this way of showing output is fully our choice in this textbook, and that you should expect other output formats elsewhere. For example, in my RStudio console, the above code and output looks like this: &gt; 1 + 3 [1] 4 1.7 ScPoEconometrics Package To fully take advantage of our course, please install the associated R package directly from its online code repository. You can do this by copy and pasting the following three lines into your R console: if (!require(&quot;devtools&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) install_github(repo = &quot;ScPoEcon/ScPoEconometrics&quot;) In order to check whether everything works fine, you could load the library, and check it’s current version: library(ScPoEconometrics) packageVersion(&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;) #OUT&gt; [1] &#39;0.2.6&#39; 1.8 Data Types R has a number of basic data types. While R is not a strongly typed language (i.e. you can be agnostic about types most of the times), it is useful to know what data types are available to you: Numeric Also known as Double. The default type when dealing with numbers. Examples: 1, 1.0, 42.5 Integer Examples: 1L, 2L, 42L Complex Example: 4 + 2i Logical Two possible values: TRUE and FALSE You can also use T and F, but this is not recommended. NA is also considered logical. Character Examples: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;Statistics&quot;, &quot;1 plus 2.&quot; Categorical or factor A mixture of integer and character. A factor variable assigns a label to a numeric value. For example factor(x=c(0,1),labels=c(&quot;male&quot;,&quot;female&quot;)) assigns the string male to the numeric values 0, and the string female to the value 1. 1.9 Data Structures R also has a number of basic data structures. A data structure is either homogeneous (all elements are of the same data type) or heterogeneous (elements can be of more than one data type). Dimension Homogeneous Heterogeneous 1 Vector List 2 Matrix Data Frame 3+ Array nested Lists 1.9.1 Vectors Many operations in R make heavy use of vectors. A vector is a container for objects of identical type (see 1.8 above). Vectors in R are indexed starting at 1. That is what the [1] in the output is indicating, that the first element of the row being displayed is the first element of the vector. Larger vectors will start additional rows with something like [7] where 7 is the index of the first element of that row. Possibly the most common way to create a vector in R is using the c() function, which is short for “combine”. As the name suggests, it combines a list of elements separated by commas. (Are you busy typing all of those examples into your R console? :-) ) c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 Here R simply outputs this vector. If we would like to store this vector in a variable we can do so with the assignment operator =. In this case the variable x now holds the vector we just created, and we can access the vector by typing x. x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) x #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 As an aside, there is a long history of the assignment operator in R, partially due to the keys available on the keyboards of the creators of the S language. (Which preceded R.) For simplicity we will use =, but know that often you will see &lt;- as the assignment operator. Because vectors must contain elements that are all the same type, R will automatically coerce (i.e. convert) to a single type when attempting to create a vector that combines multiple types. c(42, &quot;Statistics&quot;, TRUE) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;42&quot; &quot;Statistics&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; c(42, TRUE) #OUT&gt; [1] 42 1 Frequently you may wish to create a vector based on a sequence of numbers. The quickest and easiest way to do this is with the : operator, which creates a sequence of integers between two specified integers. (y = 1:100) #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 #OUT&gt; [19] 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 #OUT&gt; [37] 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 #OUT&gt; [55] 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 #OUT&gt; [73] 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 #OUT&gt; [91] 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 Here we see R labeling the rows after the first since this is a large vector. Also, we see that by putting parentheses around the assignment, R both stores the vector in a variable called y and automatically outputs y to the console. Note that scalars do not exists in R. They are simply vectors of length 1. 2 #OUT&gt; [1] 2 If we want to create a sequence that isn’t limited to integers and increasing by 1 at a time, we can use the seq() function. seq(from = 1.5, to = 4.2, by = 0.1) #OUT&gt; [1] 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 #OUT&gt; [20] 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 We will discuss functions in detail later, but note here that the input labels from, to, and by are optional. seq(1.5, 4.2, 0.1) #OUT&gt; [1] 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 #OUT&gt; [20] 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 Another common operation to create a vector is rep(), which can repeat a single value a number of times. rep(&quot;A&quot;, times = 10) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; The rep() function can be used to repeat a vector some number of times. rep(x, times = 3) #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 We have now seen four different ways to create vectors: c() : seq() rep() So far we have mostly used them in isolation, but they are often used together. c(x, rep(seq(1, 9, 2), 3), c(1, 2, 3), 42, 2:4) #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 2 3 42 #OUT&gt; [26] 2 3 4 The length of a vector can be obtained with the length() function. length(x) #OUT&gt; [1] 6 length(y) #OUT&gt; [1] 100 Let’s try this out! Your turn: 1.9.1.1 Task 1 Create a vector of five ones, i.e. [1,1,1,1,1] Notice that the colon operator a:b is just short for construct a sequence from a to b. Create a vector the counts down from 10 to 0, i.e. it looks like [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]! the rep function takes additional arguments times (as above), and each, which tells you how often each element should be repeated (as opposed to the entire input vector). Use rep to create a vector that looks like this: [1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3] 1.9.1.2 Subsetting To subset a vector, i.e. to choose only some elements of it, we use square brackets, []. Here we see that x[1] returns the first element, and x[3] returns the third element: x #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 x[1] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 x[3] #OUT&gt; [1] 5 We can also exclude certain indexes, in this case the second element. x[-2] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 5 7 8 9 Lastly we see that we can subset based on a vector of indices. x[1:3] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 x[c(1,3,4)] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 5 7 All of the above are subsetting a vector using a vector of indexes. (Remember a single number is still a vector.) We could instead use a vector of logical values. z = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) z #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE x[z] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 7 8 R is able to perform many operations on vectors and scalars alike: x = 1:10 # a vector x + 1 # add a scalar #OUT&gt; [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 2 * x # multiply all elements by 2 #OUT&gt; [1] 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 ^ x # take 2 to the x as exponents #OUT&gt; [1] 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 sqrt(x) # compute the square root of all elements in x #OUT&gt; [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 2.828427 #OUT&gt; [9] 3.000000 3.162278 log(x) # take the natural log of all elements in x #OUT&gt; [1] 0.0000000 0.6931472 1.0986123 1.3862944 1.6094379 1.7917595 1.9459101 #OUT&gt; [8] 2.0794415 2.1972246 2.3025851 x + 2*x # add vector x to vector 2x #OUT&gt; [1] 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 We see that when a function like log() is called on a vector x, a vector is returned which has applied the function to each element of the vector x. 1.9.2 Logical Operators Operator Summary Example Result x &lt; y x less than y 3 &lt; 42 TRUE x &gt; y x greater than y 3 &gt; 42 FALSE x &lt;= y x less than or equal to y 3 &lt;= 42 TRUE x &gt;= y x greater than or equal to y 3 &gt;= 42 FALSE x == y xequal to y 3 == 42 FALSE x != y x not equal to y 3 != 42 TRUE !x not x !(3 &gt; 42) TRUE x | y x or y (3 &gt; 42) | TRUE TRUE x &amp; y x and y (3 &lt; 4) &amp; ( 42 &gt; 13) TRUE In R, logical operators also work on vectors: x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) x &gt; 3 #OUT&gt; [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE x &lt; 3 #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE x == 3 #OUT&gt; [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE x != 3 #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE x == 3 &amp; x != 3 #OUT&gt; [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE x == 3 | x != 3 #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE This is quite useful for subsetting. x[x &gt; 3] #OUT&gt; [1] 5 7 8 9 x[x != 3] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 5 7 8 9 sum(x &gt; 3) #OUT&gt; [1] 4 as.numeric(x &gt; 3) #OUT&gt; [1] 0 0 1 1 1 1 Here we saw that using the sum() function on a vector of logical TRUE and FALSE values that is the result of x &gt; 3 results in a numeric result: you just counted for how many elements of x, the condition &gt; 3 is TRUE. During the call to sum(), R is first automatically coercing the logical to numeric where TRUE is 1 and FALSE is 0. This coercion from logical to numeric happens for most mathematical operations. # which(condition of x) returns true/false # each index of x where condition is true which(x &gt; 3) #OUT&gt; [1] 3 4 5 6 x[which(x &gt; 3)] #OUT&gt; [1] 5 7 8 9 max(x) #OUT&gt; [1] 9 which(x == max(x)) #OUT&gt; [1] 6 which.max(x) #OUT&gt; [1] 6 1.9.2.1 Task 2 Create a vector filled with 10 numbers drawn from the uniform distribution (hint: use function runif) and store them in x. Using logical subsetting as above, get all the elements of x which are larger than 0.5, and store them in y. using the function which, store the indices of all the elements of x which are larger than 0.5 in iy. Check that y and x[iy] are identical. 1.9.3 Matrices R can also be used for matrix calculations. Matrices have rows and columns containing a single data type. In a matrix, the order of rows and columns is important. (This is not true of data frames, which we will see later.) Matrices can be created using the matrix function. x = 1:9 x #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X = matrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3) X #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 5 8 #OUT&gt; [3,] 3 6 9 Notice here that R is case sensitive (x vs X). By default the matrix function fills your data into the matrix column by column. But we can also tell R to fill rows instead: Y = matrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE) Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 2 3 #OUT&gt; [2,] 4 5 6 #OUT&gt; [3,] 7 8 9 We can also create a matrix of a specified dimension where every element is the same, in this case 0. Z = matrix(0, 2, 4) Z #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] #OUT&gt; [1,] 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 0 0 0 Like vectors, matrices can be subsetted using square brackets, []. However, since matrices are two-dimensional, we need to specify both a row and a column when subsetting. X #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 5 8 #OUT&gt; [3,] 3 6 9 X[1, 2] #OUT&gt; [1] 4 Here we accessed the element in the first row and the second column. We could also subset an entire row or column. X[1, ] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 4 7 X[, 2] #OUT&gt; [1] 4 5 6 We can also use vectors to subset more than one row or column at a time. Here we subset to the first and third column of the second row: X[2, c(1, 3)] #OUT&gt; [1] 2 8 Matrices can also be created by combining vectors as columns, using cbind, or combining vectors as rows, using rbind. x = 1:9 rev(x) #OUT&gt; [1] 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 rep(1, 9) #OUT&gt; [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 rbind(x, rev(x), rep(1, 9)) #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] #OUT&gt; x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #OUT&gt; 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 #OUT&gt; 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 cbind(col_1 = x, col_2 = rev(x), col_3 = rep(1, 9)) #OUT&gt; col_1 col_2 col_3 #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 9 1 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 8 1 #OUT&gt; [3,] 3 7 1 #OUT&gt; [4,] 4 6 1 #OUT&gt; [5,] 5 5 1 #OUT&gt; [6,] 6 4 1 #OUT&gt; [7,] 7 3 1 #OUT&gt; [8,] 8 2 1 #OUT&gt; [9,] 9 1 1 When using rbind and cbind you can specify “argument” names that will be used as column names. R can then be used to perform matrix calculations. x = 1:9 y = 9:1 X = matrix(x, 3, 3) Y = matrix(y, 3, 3) X #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 5 8 #OUT&gt; [3,] 3 6 9 Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 9 6 3 #OUT&gt; [2,] 8 5 2 #OUT&gt; [3,] 7 4 1 X + Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 10 10 10 #OUT&gt; [2,] 10 10 10 #OUT&gt; [3,] 10 10 10 X - Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] -8 -2 4 #OUT&gt; [2,] -6 0 6 #OUT&gt; [3,] -4 2 8 X * Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 9 24 21 #OUT&gt; [2,] 16 25 16 #OUT&gt; [3,] 21 24 9 X / Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 0.1111111 0.6666667 2.333333 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0.2500000 1.0000000 4.000000 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0.4285714 1.5000000 9.000000 Note that X * Y is not matrix multiplication. It is element by element multiplication. (Same for X / Y). Matrix multiplication uses %*%. Other matrix functions include t() which gives the transpose of a matrix and solve() which returns the inverse of a square matrix if it is invertible. X %*% Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 90 54 18 #OUT&gt; [2,] 114 69 24 #OUT&gt; [3,] 138 84 30 t(X) #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 2 3 #OUT&gt; [2,] 4 5 6 #OUT&gt; [3,] 7 8 9 1.9.4 Arrays A vector is a one-dimensional array. A matrix is a two-dimensional array. In R you can create arrays of arbitrary dimensionality N. Here is how: d = 1:16 d3 = array(data = d,dim = c(4,2,2)) d4 = array(data = d,dim = c(4,2,2,3)) # will recycle 1:16 d3 #OUT&gt; , , 1 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 5 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 6 #OUT&gt; [3,] 3 7 #OUT&gt; [4,] 4 8 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; , , 2 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] #OUT&gt; [1,] 9 13 #OUT&gt; [2,] 10 14 #OUT&gt; [3,] 11 15 #OUT&gt; [4,] 12 16 You can see that d3 are simply two (4,2) matrices laid on top of each other, as if there were two pages. Similary, d4 would have two pages, and another 3 registers in a fourth dimension. And so on. You can subset an array like you would a vector or a matrix, taking care to index each dimension: d3[ ,1,1] # all elements from col 1, page 1 #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 d3[2:3, , ] # rows 2:3 from all pages #OUT&gt; , , 1 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] #OUT&gt; [1,] 2 6 #OUT&gt; [2,] 3 7 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; , , 2 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] #OUT&gt; [1,] 10 14 #OUT&gt; [2,] 11 15 d3[2,2, ] # row 2, col 2 from both pages. #OUT&gt; [1] 6 14 1.9.4.1 Task 3 Create a vector containing 1,2,3,4,5 called v. Create a (2,5) matrix m containing the data 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. The first row should be 1,2,3,4,5. Perform matrix multiplication of m with v. Use the command %*%. What dimension does the output have? Why does v %*% m not work? 1.9.5 Lists A list is a one-dimensional heterogeneous data structure. So it is indexed like a vector with a single integer value (or with a name), but each element can contain an element of any type. Lists are similar to a python or julia Dict object. Many R structures and outputs are lists themselves. Lists are extremely useful and versatile objects, so make sure you understand their useage: # creation without fieldnames list(42, &quot;Hello&quot;, TRUE) #OUT&gt; [[1]] #OUT&gt; [1] 42 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [[2]] #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Hello&quot; #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [[3]] #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE # creation with fieldnames ex_list = list( a = c(1, 2, 3, 4), b = TRUE, c = &quot;Hello!&quot;, d = function(arg = 42) {print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)}, e = diag(5) ) Lists can be subset using two syntaxes, the $ operator, and square brackets []. The $ operator returns a named element of a list. The [] syntax returns a list, while the [[]] returns an element of a list. ex_list[1] returns a list contain the first element. ex_list[[1]] returns the first element of the list, in this case, a vector. # subsetting ex_list$e #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 #OUT&gt; [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 #OUT&gt; [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 ex_list[1:2] #OUT&gt; $a #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; $b #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE ex_list[1] #OUT&gt; $a #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 ex_list[[1]] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 ex_list[c(&quot;e&quot;, &quot;a&quot;)] #OUT&gt; $e #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 #OUT&gt; [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 #OUT&gt; [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; $a #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 ex_list[&quot;e&quot;] #OUT&gt; $e #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 #OUT&gt; [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 #OUT&gt; [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 ex_list[[&quot;e&quot;]] #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 #OUT&gt; [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 #OUT&gt; [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 ex_list$d #OUT&gt; function(arg = 42) {print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)} ex_list$d(arg = 1) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Hello World!&quot; 1.9.5.1 Task 4 Copy and paste the above code for ex_list into your R session. Remember that list can hold any kind of R object. Like…another list! So, create a new list new_list that has two fields: a first field called “this” with string content &quot;is awesome&quot;, and a second field called “ex_list” that contains ex_list. Accessing members is like in a plain list, just with several layers now. Get the element c from ex_list in new_list! Compose a new string out of the first element in new_list, the element under label this. Use the function paste to print R is awesome to your screen. 1.10 Data Frames We have previously seen vectors and matrices for storing data as we introduced R. We will now introduce a data frame which will be the most common way that we store and interact with data in this course. A data.frame is similar to a python pandas.dataframe or a julia DataFrame. (But the R version was the first! :-) ) example_data = data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), y = c(rep(&quot;Hello&quot;, 9), &quot;Goodbye&quot;), z = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5)) Unlike a matrix, which can be thought of as a vector rearranged into rows and columns, a data frame is not required to have the same data type for each element. A data frame is a list of vectors, and each vector has a name. So, each vector must contain the same data type, but the different vectors can store different data types. Note, however, that all vectors must have the same length (differently from a list)! A data.frame is similar to a typical Spreadsheet. There are rows, and there are columns. A row is typically thought of as an observation, and each column is a certain variable, characteristic or feature of that observation. Let’s look at the data frame we just created above: example_data #OUT&gt; x y z #OUT&gt; 1 1 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 2 3 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 3 5 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 4 7 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 5 9 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 6 1 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 7 3 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 8 5 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 9 7 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 10 9 Goodbye FALSE Unlike a list, which has more flexibility, the elements of a data frame must all be vectors. Again, we access any given column with the $ operator: example_data$x #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 all.equal(length(example_data$x), length(example_data$y), length(example_data$z)) #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE str(example_data) #OUT&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 10 obs. of 3 variables: #OUT&gt; $ x: num 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 #OUT&gt; $ y: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Goodbye&quot;,&quot;Hello&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 #OUT&gt; $ z: logi TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE ... nrow(example_data) #OUT&gt; [1] 10 ncol(example_data) #OUT&gt; [1] 3 dim(example_data) #OUT&gt; [1] 10 3 names(example_data) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; 1.10.1 Working with data.frames The data.frame() function above is one way to create a data frame. We can also import data from various file types in into R, as well as use data stored in packages. To read this data back into R, we will use the built-in function read.csv: path = system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;,&quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;example-data.csv&quot;) example_data_from_disk = read.csv(path) This particular line of code assumes that you installed the associated R package to this book, hence you have this dataset stored on your computer at system.file(package = &quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;,&quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;example-data.csv&quot;). example_data_from_disk #OUT&gt; x y z #OUT&gt; 1 1 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 2 3 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 3 5 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 4 7 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 5 9 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 6 1 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 7 3 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 8 5 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 9 7 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 10 9 Goodbye FALSE When using data, there are three things we would generally like to do: Look at the raw data. Understand the data. (Where did it come from? What are the variables? Etc.) Visualize the data. To look at data in a data.frame, we have two useful commands: head() and str(). # we are working with the built-in mtcars dataset: mtcars #OUT&gt; mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 #OUT&gt; Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 #OUT&gt; Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 #OUT&gt; Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 #OUT&gt; Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 #OUT&gt; Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 #OUT&gt; Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 #OUT&gt; Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 #OUT&gt; Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4 #OUT&gt; Merc 280C 17.8 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90 1 0 4 4 #OUT&gt; Merc 450SE 16.4 8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40 0 0 3 3 #OUT&gt; Merc 450SL 17.3 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60 0 0 3 3 #OUT&gt; Merc 450SLC 15.2 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00 0 0 3 3 #OUT&gt; Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98 0 0 3 4 #OUT&gt; Lincoln Continental 10.4 8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82 0 0 3 4 #OUT&gt; Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42 0 0 3 4 #OUT&gt; Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 #OUT&gt; Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 #OUT&gt; Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 #OUT&gt; Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 #OUT&gt; Dodge Challenger 15.5 8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87 0 0 3 2 #OUT&gt; AMC Javelin 15.2 8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30 0 0 3 2 #OUT&gt; Camaro Z28 13.3 8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41 0 0 3 4 #OUT&gt; Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05 0 0 3 2 #OUT&gt; Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 #OUT&gt; Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 #OUT&gt; Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 #OUT&gt; Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50 0 1 5 4 #OUT&gt; Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50 0 1 5 6 #OUT&gt; Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60 0 1 5 8 #OUT&gt; Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 You can see that this prints the entire data.frame to screen.

In this dataset an observation is for a particular model of a car, and the variables describe attributes of the car, for example its fuel efficiency, or its weight. To understand more about the data set, we use the ? operator to pull up the documentation for the data. ?mtcars R has a number of functions for quickly working with and extracting basic information from data frames. To quickly obtain a vector of the variable names, we use the names() function. names(mtcars) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;mpg&quot; &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; &quot;hp&quot; &quot;drat&quot; &quot;wt&quot; &quot;qsec&quot; &quot;vs&quot; &quot;am&quot; &quot;gear&quot; #OUT&gt; [11] &quot;carb&quot; To access one of the variables as a vector, we use the $ operator. mtcars$mpg #OUT&gt; [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 17.8 16.4 17.3 15.2 10.4 #OUT&gt; [16] 10.4 14.7 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 15.5 15.2 13.3 19.2 27.3 26.0 30.4 15.8 19.7 #OUT&gt; [31] 15.0 21.4 mtcars$wt #OUT&gt; [1] 2.620 2.875 2.320 3.215 3.440 3.460 3.570 3.190 3.150 3.440 3.440 4.070 #OUT&gt; [13] 3.730 3.780 5.250 5.424 5.345 2.200 1.615 1.835 2.465 3.520 3.435 3.840 #OUT&gt; [25] 3.845 1.935 2.140 1.513 3.170 2.770 3.570 2.780 We can use the dim(), nrow() and ncol() functions to obtain information about the dimension of the data frame. dim(mtcars) #OUT&gt; [1] 32 11 nrow(mtcars) #OUT&gt; [1] 32 ncol(mtcars) #OUT&gt; [1] 11 Here nrow() is also the number of observations, which in most cases is the sample size. Subsetting data frames can work much like subsetting matrices using square brackets, [ , ]. Here, we find vehicles with mpg over 25 miles per gallon and only display columns cyl, disp and wt. # mpg[row condition, col condition] mtcars[mtcars$mpg &gt; 20, c(&quot;cyl&quot;, &quot;disp&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;)] #OUT&gt; cyl disp wt #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 6 160.0 2.620 #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 Wag 6 160.0 2.875 #OUT&gt; Datsun 710 4 108.0 2.320 #OUT&gt; Hornet 4 Drive 6 258.0 3.215 #OUT&gt; Merc 240D 4 146.7 3.190 #OUT&gt; Merc 230 4 140.8 3.150 #OUT&gt; Fiat 128 4 78.7 2.200 #OUT&gt; Honda Civic 4 75.7 1.615 #OUT&gt; Toyota Corolla 4 71.1 1.835 #OUT&gt; Toyota Corona 4 120.1 2.465 #OUT&gt; Fiat X1-9 4 79.0 1.935 #OUT&gt; Porsche 914-2 4 120.3 2.140 #OUT&gt; Lotus Europa 4 95.1 1.513 #OUT&gt; Volvo 142E 4 121.0 2.780 An alternative would be to use the subset() function, which has a much more readable syntax. subset(mtcars, subset = mpg &gt; 25, select = c(&quot;cyl&quot;, &quot;disp&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;)) 1.10.1.1 Task 5 How many observations are there in mtcars? How many variables? What is the average value of mpg? What is the average value of mpg for cars with more than 4 cylinders, i.e. with cyl&gt;4? 1.11 Programming Basics In this section we illustrate some general concepts related to programming. 1.11.1 Variables We encountered the term variable already several times, but mainly in the context of a column of a data.frame. In programming, a variable is denotes an object. Another way to say it is that a variable is a name or a label for something: x = 1 y = &quot;roses&quot; z = function(x){sqrt(x)} Here x refers to the value 1, y holds the string “roses”, and z is the name of a function that computes \\(\\sqrt{x}\\). Notice that the argument x of the function is different from the x we just defined. It is local to the function: x #OUT&gt; [1] 1 z(9) #OUT&gt; [1] 3 1.11.2 Control Flow Control Flow relates to ways in which you can adapt your code to different circumstances. Based on a condition being TRUE, your program will do one thing, as opposed to another thing. This is most widely known as an if/else statement. In R, the if/else syntax is: if (condition = TRUE) { some R code } else { some other R code } For example, x = 1 y = 3 if (x &gt; y) { # test if x &gt; y # if TRUE z = x * y print(&quot;x is larger than y&quot;) } else { # if FALSE z = x + 5 * y print(&quot;x is less than or equal to y&quot;) } #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;x is less than or equal to y&quot; z #OUT&gt; [1] 16 1.11.3 Loops Loops are a very important programming construct. As the name suggests, in a loop, the programming repeatedly loops over a set of instructions, until some condition tells it to stop. A very powerful, yet simple, construction is that the program can count how many steps it has done already - which may be important to know for many algorithms. The syntax of a for loop (there are others), is for (ix in 1:10){ # does not have to be 1:10! # loop body: gets executed each time # the value of ix changes with each iteration } For example, consider this simple for loop, which will simply print the value of the iterator (called i in this case) to screen: for (i in 1:5){ print(i) } #OUT&gt; [1] 1 #OUT&gt; [1] 2 #OUT&gt; [1] 3 #OUT&gt; [1] 4 #OUT&gt; [1] 5 Notice that instead of 1:5, we could have any kind of iterable collection: for (i in c(&quot;mangos&quot;,&quot;bananas&quot;,&quot;apples&quot;)){ print(paste(&quot;I love&quot;,i)) # the paste function pastes together strings } #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;I love mangos&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;I love bananas&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;I love apples&quot; We often also see nested loops, which are just what its name suggests: for (i in 2:3){ # first nest: for each i for (j in c(&quot;mangos&quot;,&quot;bananas&quot;,&quot;apples&quot;)){ # second nest: for each j print(paste(&quot;Can I get&quot;,i,j,&quot;please?&quot;)) } } #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 2 mangos please?&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 2 bananas please?&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 2 apples please?&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 3 mangos please?&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 3 bananas please?&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 3 apples please?&quot; The important thing to note here is that you can do calculations with the iterators while inside a loop. 1.11.4 Functions So far we have been using functions, but haven’t actually discussed some of their details. A function is a set of instructions that R executes for us, much like those collected in a script file. The good thing is that functions are much more flexible than scripts, since they can depend on input arguments, which change the way the function behaves. Here is how to define a function: function_name &lt;- function(arg1,arg2=default_value){ # function body # you do stuff with arg1 and arg2 # you can have any number of arguments, with or without defaults # any valid `R` commands can be included here # the last line is returned } And here is a trivial example of a function definition: hello &lt;- function(your_name = &quot;Lord Vader&quot;){ paste(&quot;You R most welcome,&quot;,your_name) # we could also write: # return(paste(&quot;You R most welcome,&quot;,your_name)) } # we call the function by typing it&#39;s name with round brackets hello() #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;You R most welcome, Lord Vader&quot; You see that by not specifying the argument your_name, R reverts to the default value given. Try with your own name now! Just typing the function name returns the actual definition to us, which is handy sometimes: hello #OUT&gt; function(your_name = &quot;Lord Vader&quot;){ #OUT&gt; paste(&quot;You R most welcome,&quot;,your_name) #OUT&gt; # we could also write: #OUT&gt; # return(paste(&quot;You R most welcome,&quot;,your_name)) #OUT&gt; } It’s instructive to consider that before we defined the function hello above, R did not know what to do, had you called hello(). The function did not exist! In this sense, we taught R a new trick. This feature to create new capabilities on top of a core language is one of the most powerful characteristics of programming languages. In general, it is good practice to split your code into several smaller functions, rather than one long script file. It makes your code more readable, and it is easier to track down mistakes. 1.11.4.1 Task 6 Write a for loop that counts down from 10 to 1, printing the value of the iterator to the screen. Modify that loop to write “i iterations to go” where i is the iterator Modify that loop so that each iteration takes roughly one second. You can achieve that by adding the command Sys.sleep(1) below the line that prints “i iterations to go”. When programming, it is often a good practice to follow a style guide. (Where do spaces go? Tabs or spaces? Underscores or CamelCase when naming variables?) No style guide is “correct” but it helps to be aware of what others do. The more import thing is to be consistent within your own code. Here are two guides: Hadley Wickham Style Guide, and the Google Style Guide. For this course, our main deviation from these two guides is the use of = in place of &lt;-. For all practical purposes, you should think = whenever you see &lt;-.↩ "],
["sum.html", "Chapter 2 Working With Data 2.1 Summary Statistics 2.2 Plotting 2.3 Summarizing Two Variables 2.4 The tidyverse", " Chapter 2 Working With Data In this chapter we will first learn some basic concepts that help summarizing data. Then, we will tackle a real-world task and read, clean, and summarize data from the web. 2.1 Summary Statistics R has built in functions for a large number of summary statistics. For numeric variables, we can summarize data by looking at their center and spread, for example. # for the mpg dataset, we load: library(ggplot2) Central Tendency Suppose we want to know the mean and median of all the values stored in the data.frame column mpg$cty: Measure R Result Mean mean(mpg$cty) 16.8589744 Median median(mpg$cty) 17 Spread How do the values in that column vary? How far spread out are they? Measure R Result Variance var(mpg$cty) 18.1130736 Standard Deviation sd(mpg$cty) 4.2559457 IQR IQR(mpg$cty) 5 Minimum min(mpg$cty) 9 Maximum max(mpg$cty) 35 Range range(mpg$cty) 9, 35 Categorical For categorical variables, counts and percentages can be used for summary. table(mpg$drv) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; 4 f r #OUT&gt; 103 106 25 table(mpg$drv) / nrow(mpg) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; 4 f r #OUT&gt; 0.4401709 0.4529915 0.1068376 2.2 Plotting Now that we have some data to work with, and we have learned about the data at the most basic level, our next tasks will be to visualize it. Often, a proper visualization can illuminate features of the data that can inform further analysis. We will look at four methods of visualizing data by using the basic plot facilities built-in with R: Histograms Barplots Boxplots Scatterplots 2.2.1 Histograms When visualizing a single numerical variable, a histogram is useful. It summarizes the distribution of values in a vector. In R you create one using the hist() function: hist(mpg$cty) The histogram function has a number of parameters which can be changed to make our plot look much nicer. Use the ? operator to read the documentation for the hist() to see a full list of these parameters. hist(mpg$cty, xlab = &quot;Miles Per Gallon (City)&quot;, main = &quot;Histogram of MPG (City)&quot;, # main title breaks = 12, # how many breaks? col = &quot;red&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) Importantly, you should always be sure to label your axes and give the plot a title. The argument breaks is specific to hist(). Entering an integer will give a suggestion to R for how many bars to use for the histogram. By default R will attempt to intelligently guess a good number of breaks, but as we can see here, it is sometimes useful to modify this yourself. 2.2.2 Barplots Somewhat similar to a histogram, a barplot can provide a visual summary of a categorical variable, or a numeric variable with a finite number of values, like a ranking from 1 to 10. barplot(table(mpg$drv)) barplot(table(mpg$drv), xlab = &quot;Drivetrain (f = FWD, r = RWD, 4 = 4WD)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;, main = &quot;Drivetrains&quot;, col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;, border = &quot;darkorange&quot;) 2.2.3 Boxplots To visualize the relationship between a numerical and categorical variable, once could use a boxplot. In the mpg dataset, the drv variable takes a small, finite number of values. A car can only be front wheel drive, 4 wheel drive, or rear wheel drive. unique(mpg$drv) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;f&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;r&quot; First note that we can use a single boxplot as an alternative to a histogram for visualizing a single numerical variable. To do so in R, we use the boxplot() function. The box shows the interquartile range, the solid line in the middle is the value of the median, the wiskers show 1.5 times the interquartile range, and the dots are outliers. boxplot(mpg$hwy) However, more often we will use boxplots to compare a numerical variable for different values of a categorical variable. boxplot(hwy ~ drv, data = mpg) Here used the boxplot() command to create side-by-side boxplots. However, since we are now dealing with two variables, the syntax has changed. The R syntax hwy ~ drv, data = mpg reads “Plot the hwy variable against the drv variable using the dataset mpg.” We see the use of a ~ (which specifies a formula) and also a data = argument. This will be a syntax that is common to many functions we will use in this course. boxplot(hwy ~ drv, data = mpg, xlab = &quot;Drivetrain (f = FWD, r = RWD, 4 = 4WD)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Miles Per Gallon (Highway)&quot;, main = &quot;MPG (Highway) vs Drivetrain&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;darkorange&quot;, border = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;) Again, boxplot() has a number of additional arguments which have the ability to make our plot more visually appealing. 2.2.4 Scatterplots Lastly, to visualize the relationship between two numeric variables we will use a scatterplot. This can be done with the plot() function and the ~ syntax we just used with a boxplot. (The function plot() can also be used more generally; see the documentation for details.) plot(hwy ~ displ, data = mpg) plot(hwy ~ displ, data = mpg, xlab = &quot;Engine Displacement (in Liters)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Miles Per Gallon (Highway)&quot;, main = &quot;MPG (Highway) vs Engine Displacement&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;) 2.2.5 ggplot All of the above plots could also have been generated using the ggplot function from the already loaded ggplot2 package. Which function you use is up to you, but sometimes a plot is easier to build in base R (like in the boxplot example maybe), sometimes the other way around. ggplot(data = mpg,mapping = aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) + geom_point() ggplot is impossible to describe in brief terms, so please look at the package’s website which provides excellent guidance. We will from time to time use ggplot in this book, so you could familiarize yourself with it. Let’s quickly demonstrate how one could further customize that first plot: ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) + # ggplot() makes base plot geom_point(color=&quot;blue&quot;,size=2) + # how to show x and y? scale_y_continuous(name=&quot;Miles Per Gallon (Highway)&quot;) + # name of y axis scale_x_continuous(name=&quot;Engine Displacement (in Liters)&quot;) + # x axis theme_bw() + # change the background ggtitle(&quot;MPG (Highway) vs Engine Displacement&quot;) # add a title If you want to see ggplot in action, you could start with this and then look at that very nice tutorial? It’s fun! 2.3 Summarizing Two Variables We often are interested in how two variables are related to each other. The core concepts here are covariance and correlation. Let’s generate some data on x and y and plot them against each other: Figure 2.1: How are \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) related? Taking as example the data in this plot, the concepts covariance and correlation relate to the following type of question: Given we observe value of something like \\(x=2\\), say, can we expect a high or a low value of \\(y\\), on average? Something like \\(y=2\\) or rather something like \\(y=-2\\)? The answer to this type of question can be addressed by computing the covariance of both variables: cov(x,y) #OUT&gt; [1] 1.041195 Here, this gives a positive number, 1.04, indicating that as one variable lies above it’s average, the other one does as well. In other words, it indicates a positive relationship. What is less clear, however, how to interpret the magnitude of 1.04. Is that a strong or a weak positive association? In fact, we cannot tell. This is because the covariance is measured in the same units as the data, and those units often differ between both variables. There is a better measure available to us though, the correlation, which is obtained by standardizing each variable. By standardizing a variable \\(x\\) one means to divide \\(x\\) by its standard deviation \\(\\sigma_x\\): \\[ z = \\frac{x}{\\sigma_x} \\] The correlation coefficient between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), commonly denoted \\(r_{x,y}\\), is then defined as \\[ r_{x,y} = \\frac{cov(x,y)}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}, \\] and we get rid of the units problem. In R, you can call directly cor(x,y) #OUT&gt; [1] 0.9142495 Now this is better. Given that the correlation has to lie in \\([-1,1]\\), a value of 0.91 is indicative of a rather strong positive relationship for the data in figure 2.1 Note that \\(x,y\\) being drawn from a continuous distribution (they are joint normally distributed) had no implication for covariance and correlation: We can compute those measures also for discrete random variables (like the throws of two dice, as you will see in one of our tutorials). 2.3.1 Visually estimating \\(\\sigma\\) Sometimes it is useful to estimate the standard deviation of some data without the help of a computer (for example during an exam ;-) ). If \\(x\\) is approximately normally distributed, 95% of its observations will lie within a range of \\(\\bar{x}\\pm\\) two standard deviations of \\(x\\). That is to say, four standard deviations of \\(x\\) cover 95% of its observations. Hence, a simple way to estimate the standard deviation for a variable is to look at the range of \\(x\\), and simply divide that number by four. Figure 2.2: visual estimation on \\(\\sigma\\). The x-axis labels min and max as well as mean of \\(x\\). This is illustrated in figure 2.2. Here we see that range(x)/4 gives 3.16 which compares favourably to the actual standard deviation 3. 2.4 The tidyverse Hadley Wickham is the author of R packages ggplot2 and also of dplyr (and also a myriad of others). With ggplot2 he introduced what is called the grammar of graphics (hence, gg) to R. Grammar in the sense that there are nouns and verbs and a syntax, i.e. rules of how nouns and verbs are to be put together to construct an understandable sentence. He has extended the grammar idea into various other packages. The tidyverse package is a collection of those packages. tidy data is data where: Each variable is a column Each observation is a row Each value is a cell Fair enough, you might say, that is a regular spreadsheet. And you are right! However, data comes to us not tidy most of the times, and we first need to clean, or tidy, it up. Once it’s in tidy format, we can use the tools in the tidyverse with great efficiency to analyse the data and stop worrying about which tool to use. 2.4.1 Reading .csv data in the tidy way We could have used the read_csv() function from the readr package to read our example dataset from the previous chapter. The readr function read_csv() has a number of advantages over the built-in read.csv. For example, it is much faster reading larger data. It also uses the tibble package to read the data as a tibble. A tibble is simply a data frame that prints with sanity. Notice in the output below that we are given additional information such as dimension and variable type. library(readr) # you need `install.packages(&quot;readr&quot;)` once! path = system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;,&quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;example-data.csv&quot;) example_data_from_disk = read_csv(path) 2.4.2 Tidy data.frames are tibbles Let’s grab some data from the ggplot2 package: data(mpg,package = &quot;ggplot2&quot;) # load dataset `mpg` from `ggplot2` package head(mpg, n = 10) #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 10 x 11 #OUT&gt; manufacturer model displ year cyl trans drv cty hwy fl class #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 audi a4 1.8 1999 4 auto(l… f 18 29 p comp… #OUT&gt; 2 audi a4 1.8 1999 4 manual… f 21 29 p comp… #OUT&gt; 3 audi a4 2 2008 4 manual… f 20 31 p comp… #OUT&gt; 4 audi a4 2 2008 4 auto(a… f 21 30 p comp… #OUT&gt; 5 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 auto(l… f 16 26 p comp… #OUT&gt; 6 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 manual… f 18 26 p comp… #OUT&gt; 7 audi a4 3.1 2008 6 auto(a… f 18 27 p comp… #OUT&gt; 8 audi a4 quat… 1.8 1999 4 manual… 4 18 26 p comp… #OUT&gt; 9 audi a4 quat… 1.8 1999 4 auto(l… 4 16 25 p comp… #OUT&gt; 10 audi a4 quat… 2 2008 4 manual… 4 20 28 p comp… The function head() will display the first n observations of the data frame, as we have seen. The head() function was more useful before tibbles. Notice that mpg is a tibble already, so the output from head() indicates there are only 10 observations. Note that this applies to head(mpg, n = 10) and not mpg itself. Also note that tibbles print a limited number of rows and columns by default.

Here, we find fuel efficient vehicles earning over 35 miles per gallon and only display manufacturer, model and year. # mpg[row condition, col condition] mpg[mpg$hwy &gt; 35, c(&quot;manufacturer&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)] #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #OUT&gt; manufacturer model year #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 2 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 3 toyota corolla 2008 #OUT&gt; 4 volkswagen jetta 1999 #OUT&gt; 5 volkswagen new beetle 1999 #OUT&gt; 6 volkswagen new beetle 1999 An alternative would be to use the subset() function, which has a much more readable syntax. subset(mpg, subset = hwy &gt; 35, select = c(&quot;manufacturer&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)) Lastly, and most tidy, we could use the filter and select functions from the dplyr package which introduces the pipe operator f(x) %&gt;% g(z) from the magrittr package. This operator takes the output of the first command, for example y = f(x), and passes it as the first argument to the next function, i.e. we’d obtain g(y,z) here.2 library(dplyr) mpg %&gt;% filter(hwy &gt; 35) %&gt;% select(manufacturer, model, year) #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #OUT&gt; manufacturer model year #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 2 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 3 toyota corolla 2008 #OUT&gt; 4 volkswagen jetta 1999 #OUT&gt; 5 volkswagen new beetle 1999 #OUT&gt; 6 volkswagen new beetle 1999 Note that the above syntax is equivalent to the following pipe-free command (which is much harder to read!): library(dplyr) select(filter(mpg, hwy &gt; 35), manufacturer, model, year) #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #OUT&gt; manufacturer model year #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 2 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 3 toyota corolla 2008 #OUT&gt; 4 volkswagen jetta 1999 #OUT&gt; 5 volkswagen new beetle 1999 #OUT&gt; 6 volkswagen new beetle 1999 All three approaches produce the same results. Which you use will be largely based on a given situation as well as your preference. 2.4.2.1 Task 1 Make sure to have the mpg dataset loaded by typing data(mpg) (and library(ggplot2) if you haven’t!). Use the table function to find out how many cars were built by mercury? What is the average year the audi’s were built in this dataset? Use the function mean on the subset of column year that corresponds to audi. (Be careful: subsetting a tibble returns a tibble (and not a vector)!. so get the year column after you have subset the tibble.) Use the dplyr piping syntax from above first with group_by and then with summarise(newvar=your_expression) to find the mean year by all manufacturers (i.e. same as previous task, but for all manufacturers. don’t write a loop!). 2.4.3 Tidy Example: Importing Non-Tidy Excel Data The data we will look at is from Eurostat on demography and migration. You should download the data yourself (click on previous link, then drill down to database by themes &gt; Population and social conditions &gt; Demograph and migration &gt; Population change - Demographic balance and crude rates at national level (demo_gind)). Once downloaded, we can read the data with the function read_excel from the package readxl, again part of the tidyverse suite. It’s important to know how the data is organized in the spreadsheet. Open the file with Excel to see: There is a heading which we don’t need. There are 5 rows with info that we don’t need. There is one table per variable (total population, males, females, etc) Each table has one row for each country, and one column for each year. As such, this data is not tidy. Now we will read the first chunk of data, from the first table: total population: library(readxl) # load the library # Notice that if you installed the R package of this book, # you have the .xls data file already at # `system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;, # &quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;demo_gind.xls&quot;)` # otherwise: # * download the file to your computer # * change the argument `path` to where you downloaded it # you may want to change your working directory with `setwd(&quot;your/directory&quot;) # or in RStudio by clicking Session &gt; Set Working Directory # total population in raw format tot_pop_raw = read_excel( path = system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;, &quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;demo_gind.xls&quot;), sheet=&quot;Data&quot;, # which sheet range=&quot;A9:K68&quot;) # which excel cell range to read names(tot_pop_raw)[1] &lt;- &quot;Country&quot; # lets rename the first column tot_pop_raw #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 59 x 11 #OUT&gt; Country `2008` `2009` `2010` `2011` `2012` `2013` `2014` `2015` `2016` `2017` #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 Europe… 50029… 50209… 50317… 50296… 50404… 50516… 50701… 50854… 51027… 51152… #OUT&gt; 2 Europe… 43872… 44004… 44066… 43994… 44055… 44125… 44266… 44366… 44489… 44571… #OUT&gt; 3 Europe… 49598… 49778… 49886… 49867… 49977… 50090… 50276… 50431… 50608… 50736… #OUT&gt; 4 Euro a… 33309… 33447… 33526… 33457… 33528… 33604… 33754… 33856… 33988… 34072… #OUT&gt; 5 Euro a… 32988… 33128… 33212… 33152… 33228… 33307… 33459… 33563… 33699… 33787… #OUT&gt; 6 Belgium 10666… 10753… 10839… 11000… 11075… 11137… 11180… 11237… 11311… 11351… #OUT&gt; 7 Bulgar… 75180… 74671… 74217… 73694… 73272… 72845… 72456… 72021… 71537… 71018… #OUT&gt; 8 Czech … 10343… 10425… 10462… 10486… 10505… 10516… 10512… 10538… 10553… 10578… #OUT&gt; 9 Denmark 54757… 55114… 55347… 55606… 55805… 56026… 56272… 56597… 57072… 57487… #OUT&gt; 10 German… 82217… 82002… 81802… 80222… 80327… 80523… 80767… 81197… 82175… 82521… #OUT&gt; # … with 49 more rows This shows a tibble, which we encountered just above. The column names are Country,2008,2009,..., and the rows are numbered 1,2,3,.... Notice, in particular, that all columns seem to be of type &lt;chr&gt;, i.e. characters - a string, not a number! We’ll have to fix that, as this is clearly numeric data. 2.4.3.1 tidyr In the previous tibble, each year is a column name (like 2008) instead of all years being collected in one column year. We really would like to have several rows for each Country, one row per year. We want to gather() all years into a new column to tidy this up - and here is how: specify which columns are to be gathered: in our case, all years (note that paste(2008:2017) produces a vector like [&quot;2008&quot;, &quot;2009&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;,...]) say what those columns should be gathered into, i.e. what is the key for those values: we’ll call it year. Finally, what is the name of the new resulting column, containing the value from each cell: let’s call it counts. library(tidyr) # for the gather function tot_pop = gather(tot_pop_raw, paste(2008:2017),key=&quot;year&quot;, value = &quot;counts&quot;) tot_pop #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 590 x 3 #OUT&gt; Country year counts #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 European Union (current composition) 2008 500297033 #OUT&gt; 2 European Union (without United Kingdom) 2008 438725386 #OUT&gt; 3 European Union (before the accession of Croatia) 2008 495985066 #OUT&gt; 4 Euro area (19 countries) 2008 333096775 #OUT&gt; 5 Euro area (18 countries) 2008 329884170 #OUT&gt; 6 Belgium 2008 10666866 #OUT&gt; 7 Bulgaria 2008 7518002 #OUT&gt; 8 Czech Republic 2008 10343422 #OUT&gt; 9 Denmark 2008 5475791 #OUT&gt; 10 Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG) 2008 82217837 #OUT&gt; # … with 580 more rows That’s better! However, counts is still chr! Let’s convert it to a number: tot_pop$counts = as.integer(tot_pop$counts) #OUT&gt; Warning: NAs introduced by coercion tot_pop #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 590 x 3 #OUT&gt; Country year counts #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 European Union (current composition) 2008 500297033 #OUT&gt; 2 European Union (without United Kingdom) 2008 438725386 #OUT&gt; 3 European Union (before the accession of Croatia) 2008 495985066 #OUT&gt; 4 Euro area (19 countries) 2008 333096775 #OUT&gt; 5 Euro area (18 countries) 2008 329884170 #OUT&gt; 6 Belgium 2008 10666866 #OUT&gt; 7 Bulgaria 2008 7518002 #OUT&gt; 8 Czech Republic 2008 10343422 #OUT&gt; 9 Denmark 2008 5475791 #OUT&gt; 10 Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG) 2008 82217837 #OUT&gt; # … with 580 more rows Now you can see that column counts is indeed int, i.e. an integer number, and we are fine. The Warning: NAs introduced by coercion means that R converted some values to NA, because it couldn’t convert them into numeric. More below! 2.4.3.2 dplyr The transform chapter of Hadley Wickham’s book is a great place to read up more on using dplyr. With dplyr you can do the following operations on data.frames and tibbles: Choose observations based on a certain value (i.e. subset): filter() Reorder rows: arrange() Select variables by name: select() Create new variables out of existing ones: mutate() Summarise variables: summarise() All of those verbs can be used with group_by(), where we apply the respective operation on a group of the dataframe/tibble. For example, on our tot_pop tibble we will now filter mutate and plot the resulting values Let’s get a plot of the populations of France, the UK and Italy over time, in terms of millions of people. We will make use of the piping syntax of dplyr which we introduced just above. library(dplyr) # for %&gt;%, filter, mutate, ... # 1. take the data.frame `tot_pop` tot_pop %&gt;% # 2. pipe it into the filter function # filter on Country being one of &quot;France&quot;,&quot;United Kingdom&quot; or &quot;Italy&quot; filter(Country %in% c(&quot;France&quot;,&quot;United Kingdom&quot;,&quot;Italy&quot;)) %&gt;% # 3. pipe the result into the mutate function # create a new column called millions mutate(millions = counts / 1e6) %&gt;% # 4. pipe the result into ggplot to make a plot ggplot(mapping = aes(x=year,y=millions,color=Country,group=Country)) + geom_line(size=1) Arrange a tibble What are the top/bottom 5 most populated areas? top5 = tot_pop %&gt;% arrange(desc(counts)) %&gt;% # arrange in descending order of col `counts` top_n(5) bottom5 = tot_pop %&gt;% arrange(desc(counts)) %&gt;% top_n(-5) # let&#39;s see top 5 top5 #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 3 #OUT&gt; Country year counts #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plus IS, … 2017 5.17e8 #OUT&gt; 2 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plus IS, … 2016 5.16e8 #OUT&gt; 3 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plus IS, … 2015 5.14e8 #OUT&gt; 4 European Economic Area (EU27 - before the accession of Croati… 2017 5.13e8 #OUT&gt; 5 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plus IS, … 2014 5.12e8 # and bottom 5 bottom5 #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 3 #OUT&gt; Country year counts #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 San Marino 2015 32789 #OUT&gt; 2 San Marino 2014 32520 #OUT&gt; 3 San Marino 2008 32054 #OUT&gt; 4 San Marino 2011 31863 #OUT&gt; 5 San Marino 2009 31269 Now this is not exactly what we wanted. It’s always the same country in both top and bottom, because there are multiple years per country. Let’s compute average population over the last 5 years and rank according to that: topbottom = tot_pop %&gt;% group_by(Country) %&gt;% filter(year &gt; 2012) %&gt;% summarise(mean_count = mean(counts)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(mean_count)) top5 = topbottom %&gt;% top_n(5) bottom5 = topbottom %&gt;% top_n(-5) top5 #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 2 #OUT&gt; Country mean_count #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plus IS, LI, … 514029320 #OUT&gt; 2 European Economic Area (EU27 - before the accession of Croatia, p… 509813491. #OUT&gt; 3 European Union (current composition) 508502858. #OUT&gt; 4 European Union (before the accession of Croatia) 504287028. #OUT&gt; 5 European Union (without United Kingdom) 443638309. bottom5 #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 2 #OUT&gt; Country mean_count #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 Luxembourg 563319. #OUT&gt; 2 Malta 440467. #OUT&gt; 3 Iceland 329501. #OUT&gt; 4 Liechtenstein 37353 #OUT&gt; 5 San Marino 33014. That’s better! Look for NAs in a tibble Sometimes data is missing, and R represents it with the special value NA (not available). It is good to know where in our dataset we are going to encounter any missing values, so the task here is: let’s produce a table that has three columns: the names of countries with missing data how many years of data are missing for each of those and the actual years that are missing missings = tot_pop %&gt;% filter(is.na(counts)) %&gt;% # is.na(x) returns TRUE if x is NA group_by(Country) %&gt;% summarise(n_missing = n(),years = paste(year,collapse = &quot;, &quot;)) knitr:::kable(missings) # knitr:::kable makes a nice table Country n_missing years Albania 2 2010, 2012 Andorra 2 2014, 2015 Armenia 1 2014 France (metropolitan) 4 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 Georgia 1 2013 Monaco 7 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 Russia 4 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 San Marino 1 2010 Males and Females Let’s look at the numbers by male and female population. They are in the same xls file, but at different cell ranges. Also, I just realised that the special character : indicates missing data. We can feed that to read_excel and that will spare us the need to convert data types afterwards. Let’s see: females_raw = read_excel( path = system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;, &quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;demo_gind.xls&quot;), sheet=&quot;Data&quot;, # which sheet range=&quot;A141:K200&quot;, # which excel cell range to read na=&quot;:&quot; ) # missing data indicator names(females_raw)[1] &lt;- &quot;Country&quot; # lets rename the first column females_raw #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 59 x 11 #OUT&gt; Country `2008` `2009` `2010` `2011` `2012` `2013` `2014` `2015` `2016` `2017` #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 Europe… 2.56e8 2.57e8 2.58e8 2.58e8 2.58e8 2.59e8 2.60e8 2.60e8 2.61e8 2.61e8 #OUT&gt; 2 Europe… 2.25e8 2.26e8 2.26e8 2.26e8 2.26e8 2.26e8 2.27e8 2.27e8 2.28e8 2.28e8 #OUT&gt; 3 Europe… 2.54e8 2.55e8 2.55e8 2.56e8 2.56e8 2.57e8 2.57e8 2.58e8 2.59e8 2.59e8 #OUT&gt; 4 Euro a… 1.71e8 1.71e8 1.72e8 1.72e8 1.72e8 1.72e8 1.73e8 1.73e8 1.74e8 1.74e8 #OUT&gt; 5 Euro a… 1.69e8 1.70e8 1.70e8 1.70e8 1.70e8 1.71e8 1.71e8 1.72e8 1.72e8 1.73e8 #OUT&gt; 6 Belgium 5.44e6 5.48e6 5.53e6 5.60e6 5.64e6 5.67e6 5.69e6 5.71e6 5.74e6 5.76e6 #OUT&gt; 7 Bulgar… 3.86e6 3.83e6 3.81e6 3.78e6 3.76e6 3.74e6 3.72e6 3.70e6 3.68e6 3.65e6 #OUT&gt; 8 Czech … 5.28e6 5.31e6 5.33e6 5.34e6 5.35e6 5.35e6 5.35e6 5.36e6 5.37e6 5.38e6 #OUT&gt; 9 Denmark 2.76e6 2.78e6 2.79e6 2.80e6 2.81e6 2.82e6 2.83e6 2.85e6 2.87e6 2.89e6 #OUT&gt; 10 German… 4.19e7 4.18e7 4.17e7 4.11e7 4.11e7 4.11e7 4.12e7 4.14e7 4.17e7 4.18e7 #OUT&gt; # … with 49 more rows You can see that R now correctly read the numbers as such, after we told it that the : character has the special missing meaning: before, it coerced the entire 2008 column (for example) to be of type chr after it hit the first :. We had to manually convert the column back to numeric, in the process automatically coercing the :s into NA. Now we addressed that issue directly. Let’s also get the male data in the same way: males_raw = read_excel( path = system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;, &quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;demo_gind.xls&quot;), sheet=&quot;Data&quot;, # which sheet range=&quot;A75:K134&quot;, # which excel cell range to read na=&quot;:&quot; ) # missing data indicator names(males_raw)[1] &lt;- &quot;Country&quot; # lets rename the first column Next step was to tidy up this data, just as before: females = gather(females_raw, paste(2008:2017),key=&quot;year&quot;, value = &quot;counts&quot;) males = gather(males_raw, paste(2008:2017),key=&quot;year&quot;, value = &quot;counts&quot;) Let’s try to tweak our above plot to show the same data in two separate panels: one for males and one for females. This is easiest to do with ggplot if we have all the data in one single data.frame (or tibble), and marked with a group identifier. Let’s first add this to both datasets, and then let’s just combine both into one: females$sex = &quot;female&quot; males$sex = &quot;male&quot; sexes = rbind(males,females) # &quot;row bind&quot; 2 data.frames sexes #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 1,180 x 4 #OUT&gt; Country year counts sex #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 European Union (current composition) 2008 243990548 male #OUT&gt; 2 European Union (without United Kingdom) 2008 213826199 male #OUT&gt; 3 European Union (before the accession of Croatia) 2008 241913560 male #OUT&gt; 4 Euro area (19 countries) 2008 162516883 male #OUT&gt; 5 Euro area (18 countries) 2008 161029464 male #OUT&gt; 6 Belgium 2008 5224309 male #OUT&gt; 7 Bulgaria 2008 3660367 male #OUT&gt; 8 Czech Republic 2008 5065117 male #OUT&gt; 9 Denmark 2008 2712666 male #OUT&gt; 10 Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG) 2008 40274292 male #OUT&gt; # … with 1,170 more rows Now that we have all the data nice and tidy in a data.frame, this is a very small change to our previous plotting code: sexes %&gt;% filter(Country %in% c(&quot;France&quot;,&quot;United Kingdom&quot;,&quot;Italy&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(millions = counts / 1e6) %&gt;% ggplot(mapping = aes(x=as.Date(year,format=&quot;%Y&quot;), # convert to `Date` y=millions,colour=Country,group=Country)) + geom_line() + scale_x_date(name = &quot;year&quot;) + # rename x axis facet_wrap(~sex) # make two panels, splitting by groups `sex` Always Compare to Germany :-) How do our three countries compare with respect to the biggest country in the EU in terms of population?

We will refer throughout to the graphical representation of a collection of independent observations on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), i.e., a dataset. 3.1 How are x and y related? 3.1.1 Data on Cars We will look at the built-in cars dataset. Let’s get a view of this by just typing View(cars) in Rstudio. You can see something like this: #OUT&gt; speed dist #OUT&gt; 1 4 2 #OUT&gt; 2 4 10 #OUT&gt; 3 7 4 #OUT&gt; 4 7 22 #OUT&gt; 5 8 16 #OUT&gt; 6 9 10 We have a data.frame with two columns: speed and dist. Type help(cars) to find out more about the dataset. There you could read that The data give the speed of cars (mph) and the distances taken to stop (ft). It’s good practice to know the extent of a dataset. You could just type dim(cars) #OUT&gt; [1] 50 2 to find out that we have 50 rows and 2 columns. A central question that we want to ask now is the following: 3.1.2 How are speed and dist related? The simplest way to start is to plot the data. Remembering that we view each row of a data.frame as an observation, we could just label one axis of a graph speed, and the other one dist, and go through our table above row by row. We just have to read off the x/y coordinates and mark them in the graph. In R: plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars, xlab = &quot;Speed (in Miles Per Hour)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Stopping Distance (in Feet)&quot;, main = &quot;Stopping Distance vs Speed&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;red&quot;) Here, each dot represents one observation. In this case, one particular measurement speed and dist for a car. Now, again: How are speed and dist related? How could one best summarize this relationship? One thing we could do, is draw a straight line through this scatterplot, like so: plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars, xlab = &quot;Speed (in Miles Per Hour)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Stopping Distance (in Feet)&quot;, main = &quot;Stopping Distance vs Speed&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;red&quot;) abline(a = 60,b = 0,lw=3) Now that doesn’t seem a particularly good way to summarize the relationship. Clearly, a better line would be not be flat, but have a slope, i.e. go upwards: That is slightly better. However, the line seems at too high a level - the point at which it crosses the y-axis is called the intercept; and it’s too high. We just learned how to represent a line, i.e. with two numbers called intercept and slope. Let’s write down a simple formula which represents a line where some outcome \\(z\\) is related to a variable \\(x\\): \\[\\begin{equation} z = b_0 + b_1 x \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] Here \\(b_0\\) represents the value of the intercept (i.e. \\(z\\) when \\(x=0\\)), and \\(b_1\\) is the value of the slope. The question for us is now: How to choose the number \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) such that the result is the good line? 3.1.3 Choosing the Best Line In order to be able to reason about good or bad line, we need to denote the output of equation (3.1). We call the value \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) the predicted value for obseration \\(i\\), after having chosen some particular values \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] In general it is likely that we won’t be able to choose \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) in such as way as to provide a perfect prediction, i.e. one where \\(\\hat{y}_i = y_i\\) for all \\(i\\). That is, we expect to make an error in our prediction \\(\\hat{y}_i\\), so let’s denote this value \\(e_i\\). If we acknowlegdge that we will make errors, let’s at least make them as small as possible! Exactly this is going to be our task now. Suppose we have the following set of 9 observations on x and y, and we put the best straight line into it, that we can think of. It would look like this: Figure 3.1: The best line and its errors Here, the red arrows indicate the distance between the prediction (i.e. the black line) to each data point, in other words, each arrow is a particular \\(e_i\\). An upward pointing arrow indicates a positive value of a particular \\(e_i\\), and vice versa for downward pointing arrows. The erros are also called residuals, which comes from the way can write the equation for this relationship between two particular values \\((y_i,x_i)\\) belonging to observation \\(i\\): \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i + e_i \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] You realize of course that \\(\\hat{y}_i = y_i - e_i\\), which just means that our prediction is the observed value \\(y_i\\) minus any error \\(e_i\\) we make. In other words, \\(e_i\\) is what is left to be explained on top of the line \\(b_0 + b_1 x_i\\), hence, it’s a residual to explain \\(y_i\\). Here are \\(y,\\hat{y}\\) and the resulting \\(e\\) which are plotted in figure 3.1: x y y_hat error 0.00 2.09 2.57 -0.48 1.25 2.79 3.41 -0.62 2.50 6.49 4.25 2.24 3.75 1.71 5.10 -3.39 5.00 9.89 5.94 3.95 6.25 7.62 6.78 0.83 7.50 4.86 7.63 -2.77 8.75 7.38 8.47 -1.09 10.00 10.63 9.31 1.32 If our line was a perfect fit to the data, all \\(e_i = 0\\), and the column error would display 0 for each row - there would be no errors at all. (All points in figure 3.1 would perfectly line up on a straight line). Now, back to our claim that this particular line is the best line. What exactly characterizes this best line? We now come back to what we said above - how to make the errors as small as possible? Keeping in mind that each residual \\(e_i\\) is \\(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\), we have the following minization problem to solve: \\[\\begin{align} e_i &amp; = y_i - \\hat{y}_i = y_i - \\underbrace{\\left(b_0 + b_1 x_i\\right)}_\\text{prediction}\\\\ e_1^2 + \\dots + e_N^2 &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^N e_i^2 \\equiv \\text{SSR}(b_0,b_1) \\\\ (b_0,b_1) &amp;= \\arg \\min_{\\text{int},\\text{slope}} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[y_i - \\left(\\text{int} + \\text{slope } x_i\\right)\\right]^2 \\tag{3.4} \\end{align}\\] The best line chooses \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) so as to minimize the sum of squared residuals (SSR). Wait a moment, why squared residuals? This is easy to understand: suppose that instead, we wanted to just make the sum of the arrows in figure 3.1 as small as possible (that is, no squares). Choosing our line to make this number small would not give a particularly good representation of the data – given that errors of opposite sign and equal magnitude offset, we could have very long arrows (but of opposite signs), and a poor resulting line. Squaring each error avoids this (because now negative errors get positive values!) Figure 3.2: The best line and its SQUARED errors We illustrate this in figure 3.2. This is the same data as in figure 3.1, but instead of arrows of length \\(e_i\\) for each observation \\(i\\), now we draw a square with side \\(e_i\\), i.e. an area of \\(e_i^2\\). We have two apps for you at this point, one where you have to try and find the best line by choosing \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), only focusing on the sum of errors (and not their square), and a second one focusing on squared errors: library(ScPoEconometrics) launchApp(&quot;reg_simple_arrows&quot;) launchApp(&quot;reg_simple&quot;) # with squared errors launchApp(&quot;SSR_cone&quot;) # visualize the minimzation problem from above! Most of our apps have an associated about document, which gives extra information and explanations. After you have looked at all three apps, we invite you thus to have a look at the associated explainers by typing aboutApp(&quot;reg_simple_arrows&quot;) aboutApp(&quot;reg_simple&quot;) aboutApp(&quot;SSR_cone&quot;) 3.2 Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Estimator The method to compute (or estimate) \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) we illustrated above is called Ordinary Least Squares, or OLS. \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) are therefore also often called the OLS coefficients. By solving problem (3.4) one can derive an explicit formula for them: \\[\\begin{equation} b_1 = \\frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)}, \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] i.e. the estimate of the slope coefficient is the covariance between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) divided by the variance of \\(x\\), both computed from our sample of data. With \\(b_1\\) in hand, we can get the estimate for the intercept as \\[\\begin{equation} b_0 = \\bar{y} - b_1 \\bar{x}. \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\bar{z}\\) denotes the sample mean of variable \\(z\\). The interpretation of the OLS slope coefficient \\(b_1\\) is as follows. Given a line as in \\(y = b_0 + b_1 x\\), \\(b_1 = \\frac{d y}{d x}\\) measures the change in \\(y\\) resulting from a one unit change in \\(x\\) For example, if \\(y\\) is wage and \\(x\\) is years of education, \\(b_1\\) would measure the effect of an additional year of education on wages. There is an alternative representation for the OLS slope coefficient which relates to the correlation coefficient \\(r\\). Remember from section 2.3 that \\(r = \\frac{cov(x,y)}{s_x s_y}\\), where \\(s_z\\) is the standard deviation of variable \\(z\\). With this in hand, we can derive the OLS slope coefficient as \\[\\begin{align} b_1 &amp;= \\frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{cov(x,y)}{s_x s_x} \\\\ &amp;= r\\frac{s_y}{s_x} \\tag{3.7} \\end{align}\\] In other words, the slope coefficient is equal to the correlation coefficient \\(r\\) times the ratio of standard deviations of \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). 3.2.1 Linear Regression without Regressor There are several important special cases for the linear regression introduced above. Let’s start with the most obvious one: What is the meaning of running a regression without any regressor, i.e. without a \\(x\\)? Our line becomes very simple. Instead of (3.1), we get \\[\\begin{equation} y = b_0. \\tag{3.8} \\end{equation}\\] This means that our minization problem in (3.4) also becomes very simple: We only have to choose \\(b_0\\)! We have \\[ b_0 = \\arg\\min_{\\text{int}} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[y_i - \\text{int}\\right]^2, \\] which is a quadratic equation with a unique optimum such that \\[ b_0 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N y_i = \\overline{y}. \\] Least Squares without regressor \\(x\\) estimates the sample mean of the outcome variable \\(y\\), i.e. it produces \\(\\overline{y}\\). 3.2.2 Regression without an Intercept We follow the same logic here, just that we miss another bit from our initial equation and the minimisation problem in (3.4) now becomes: \\[\\begin{align} b_1 &amp;= \\arg\\min_{\\text{slope}} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[y_i - \\text{slope } x_i \\right]^2\\\\ \\mapsto b_1 &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i y_i}{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2} = \\frac{\\bar{x} \\bar{y}}{\\overline{x^2}} \\tag{3.9} \\end{align}\\] Least Squares without intercept (i.e. with \\(b_0=0\\)) is a line that passes through the origin. In this case we only get to choose the slope \\(b_1\\) of this anchored line.3 You should now try out both of those restrictions on our linear model by spending some time with launchApp(&quot;reg_constrained&quot;) 3.2.3 Centering A Regression By centering or demeaning a regression, we mean to substract from both \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) their respective averages to obtain \\(\\tilde{y}_i = y_i - \\bar{y}\\) and \\(\\tilde{x}_i = x_i - \\bar{x}\\). We then run a regression without intercept as above. That is, we use \\(\\tilde{x}_i,\\tilde{y}_i\\) instead of \\(x_i,y_i\\) in (3.9) to obtain our slope estimate \\(b_1\\): \\[\\begin{align} b_1 &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\tilde{x}_i \\tilde{y}_i}{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\tilde{x}_i^2}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x}) (y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)} \\tag{3.10} \\end{align}\\] This last expression is identical to the one in (3.5)! It’s the standard OLS estimate for the slope coefficient. We note the following: Adding a constant to a regression produces the same result as centering all variables and estimating without intercept. So, unless all variables are centered, always include an intercept in the regression. To get a better feel for what is going on here, you can try this out now by yourself by typing: launchApp(&quot;demeaned_reg&quot;) 3.2.4 Standardizing A Regression Standardizing a variable \\(z\\) means to demean as above, but in addition to divide the demeaned value by its own standard deviation. Similarly to what we did above for centering, we define transformed variables \\(\\breve{y}_i = \\frac{y_i-\\bar{y}}{\\sigma_y}\\) and \\(\\breve{x}_i = \\frac{x_i-\\bar{x}}{\\sigma_x}\\) where \\(\\sigma_z\\) is the standard deviation of variable \\(z\\). From here on, you should by now be used to what comes next! As above, we use \\(\\breve{x}_i,\\breve{y}_i\\) instead of \\(x_i,y_i\\) in (3.9) to this time obtain: \\[\\begin{align} b_1 &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\breve{x}_i \\breve{y}_i}{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\breve{x}_i^2}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{\\sigma_x} \\frac{y_i - \\bar{y}}{\\sigma_y}}{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(\\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{\\sigma_x}\\right)^2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{Cov(x,y)}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y} \\\\ &amp;= Corr(x,y) \\tag{3.11} \\end{align}\\] After we standardize both \\(y\\) and \\(x\\), the slope coefficient \\(b_1\\) in the regression without intercept is equal to the correlation coefficient. And also for this case we have a practical application for you. Just type this and play around with the app for a little while! launchApp(&quot;reg_standardized&quot;) 3.3 Predictions and Residuals Now we want to ask how our residuals \\(e_i\\) relate to the prediction \\(\\hat{y_i}\\). Let us first think about the average of all predictions \\(\\hat{y_i}\\), i.e. the number \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\hat{y_i}\\). Let’s just take (3.2) and plug this into this average, so that we get \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\hat{y_i} &amp;= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N b_0 + b_1 x_i \\\\ &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i \\\\ &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\bar{x} \\\\ \\end{align}\\] But that last line is just equal to the formula for the OLS intercept (3.6), \\(b_0 = \\bar{y} - b_1 \\bar{x}\\)! That means of course that \\[ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\hat{y_i} = b_0 + b_1 \\bar{x} = \\bar{y} \\] in other words: The average of our predictions \\(\\hat{y_i}\\) is identically equal to the mean of the outcome \\(y\\). This implies that the average of the residuals is equal to zero. Related to this result, we can show that the prediction \\(\\hat{y}\\) and the residuals are uncorrelated, something that is often called orthogonality between \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) and \\(e_i\\). We would write this as \\[\\begin{align} Cov(\\hat{y},e) &amp;=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\hat{y}_i-\\bar{y})(e_i-\\bar{e}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\hat{y}_i-\\bar{y})e_i \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\hat{y}_i e_i-\\bar{y} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N e_i = 0 \\end{align}\\] It’s useful to bring back the sample data which generate figure 3.1 at this point in order to verify these claims: #OUT&gt; y y_hat error #OUT&gt; 1 2.09 2.57 -0.48 #OUT&gt; 2 2.79 3.41 -0.62 #OUT&gt; 3 6.49 4.25 2.24 #OUT&gt; 4 1.71 5.10 -3.39 #OUT&gt; 5 9.89 5.94 3.95 #OUT&gt; 6 7.62 6.78 0.83 #OUT&gt; 7 4.86 7.63 -2.77 #OUT&gt; 8 7.38 8.47 -1.09 #OUT&gt; 9 10.63 9.31 1.32 Let’s check that these claims are true in this sample of data. We want that The average of \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) to be the same as the mean of \\(y\\) The average of the errors should be zero. Prediction and errors should be uncorrelated. # 1. all.equal(mean(ss$error), 0) #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE # 2. all.equal(mean(ss$y_hat), mean(ss$y)) #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE # 3. all.equal(cov(ss$error,ss$y_hat), 0) #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE So indeed we can confirm this result with our test dataset. Great! 3.4 Correlation, Covariance and Linearity It is important to keep in mind that Correlation and Covariance relate to a linear relationship between x and y. Given how the regression line is estimated by OLS (see just above), you can see that the regression line inherits this property from the Covariance. A famous exercise by Francis Anscombe (1973) illustrates this by constructing 4 different datasets which all have identical linear statistics: mean, variance, correlation and regression line are identical. However, the usefulness of the statistics to describe the relationship in the data is not clear. The important lesson from this example is the following: Always visually inspect your data, and don’t rely exclusively on summary statistics like mean, variance, correlation and regression line. All of those assume a linear relationship between the variables in your data. The mission of Anscombe has been continued recently. As a result of this we can have a look at the datasauRus package, which pursues Anscbombe’s idea through a multitude of funny data sets, all with the same linear statistics. Don’t just compute the covariance, or you might actually end up looking at a Dinosaur! What? Type this to find out: launchApp(&quot;datasaurus&quot;) aboutApp(&quot;datasaurus&quot;) 3.4.1 Non-Linear Relationships in Data Suppose our data now looks like this: Putting our previous best line defined in equation (3.3) as \\(y = b_0 + b_1 x + e\\), we get something like this: Figure 3.3: Best line with non-linear data? Somehow when looking at 3.3 one is not totally convinced that the straight line is a good summary of this relationship. For values \\(x\\in[50,120]\\) the line seems to low, then again too high, and it completely misses the right boundary. It’s easy to address this shortcoming by including higher order terms of an explanatory variable. We would modify (3.3) to read now \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i + b_2 x_i^2 + e_i \\tag{3.12} \\end{equation}\\] This is a special case of multiple regression, which we will talk about in chapter 4. You can see that there are multiple slope coefficients. For now, let’s just see how this performs: Figure 3.4: Better line with non-linear data! 3.5 Analysing \\(Var(y)\\) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) refers to a method to decompose variation in one variable as a function of several others. We can use this idea on our outcome \\(y\\). Suppose we wanted to know the variance of \\(y\\), keeping in mind that, by definition, \\(y_i = \\hat{y}_i + e_i\\). We would write \\[\\begin{align} Var(y) &amp;= Var(\\hat{y} + e)\\\\ &amp;= Var(\\hat{y}) + Var(e) + 2 Cov(\\hat{y},e)\\\\ &amp;= Var(\\hat{y}) + Var(e) \\tag{3.13} \\end{align}\\] We have seen above in 3.3 that the covariance between prediction \\(\\hat{y}\\) and error \\(e\\) is zero, that’s why we have \\(Cov(\\hat{y},e)=0\\) in (3.13). What this tells us in words is that we can decompose the variance in the observed outcome \\(y\\) into a part that relates to variance as explained by the model and a part that comes from unexplained variation. Finally, we know the definition of variance, and can thus write down the respective formulae for each part: \\(Var(y) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \\bar{y})^2\\) \\(Var(\\hat{y}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (\\hat{y_i} - \\bar{y})^2\\), because the mean of \\(\\hat{y}\\) is \\(\\bar{y}\\) as we know. Finally, \\(Var(e) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N e_i^2\\), because the mean of \\(e\\) is zero. We can thus formulate how the total variation in outcome \\(y\\) is aportioned between model and unexplained variation: The total variation in outcome \\(y\\) (often called SST, or total sum of squares) is equal to the sum of explained squares (SSE) plus the sum of residuals (SSR). We have thus SST = SSE + SSR. 3.6 Assessing the Goodness of Fit In our setup, there exists a convenient measure for how good a particular statistical model fits the data. It is called \\(R^2\\) (R squared), also called the coefficient of determination. We make use of the just introduced decomposition of variance, and write the formula as \\[\\begin{equation} R^2 = \\frac{\\text{variance explained}}{\\text{total variance}} = \\frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \\frac{SSR}{SST}\\in[0,1] \\tag{3.14} \\end{equation}\\] It is easy to see that a good fit is one where the sum of explained squares (SSE) is large relativ to the total variation (SST). In such a case, we observe an \\(R^2\\) close to one. In the opposite case, we will see an \\(R^2\\) close to zero. Notice that a small \\(R^2\\) does not imply that the model is useless, just that it explains a small fraction of the observed variation. 3.7 An Example: A Log Wage Equation Let’s consider the following example concerning wage data collected in the 1976 Current Population Survey in the USA.4 We want to investigate the relationship between average hourly earnings, and years of education. Let’s start with a plot: data(&quot;wage1&quot;, package = &quot;wooldridge&quot;) # load data # a function that returns a plot plotfun &lt;- function(wage1,log=FALSE,rug = TRUE){ y = wage1$wage if (log){ y = log(wage1$wage) } plot(y = y, x = wage1$educ, col = &quot;red&quot;, pch = 21, bg = &quot;grey&quot;, cex=1.25, xaxt=&quot;n&quot;, frame = FALSE, # set default x-axis to none main = ifelse(log,&quot;log(Wages) vs. Education, 1976&quot;,&quot;Wages vs. Education, 1976&quot;), xlab = &quot;years of education&quot;, ylab = ifelse(log,&quot;Log Hourly wages&quot;,&quot;Hourly wages&quot;)) axis(side = 1, at = c(0,6,12,18)) # add custom ticks to x axis if (rug) rug(wage1$wage, side=2, col=&quot;red&quot;) # add `rug` to y axis } par(mfcol = c(2,1)) # set up a plot with 2 panels # plot 1: standard scatter plot plotfun(wage1) # plot 2: add a panel with histogram+density hist(wage1$wage,prob = TRUE, col = &quot;grey&quot;, border = &quot;red&quot;, main = &quot;Histogram of wages and Density&quot;,xlab = &quot;hourly wage&quot;) lines(density(wage1$wage), col = &quot;black&quot;, lw = 2) Figure 3.5: Wages vs Education from the wooldridge dataset wage1. Looking at the top panel of figure 3.5, you notice two things: From the red ticks on the y axis, you see that wages are very concentrated at around 5 USD per hour, with fewer and fewer observations at higher rates; and second, that it seems that the hourly wage seems to increase with higher education levels. The bottom panel reinforces the first point, showing that the estimated pdf (probability density function) shown as a black line has a very long right tail: there are always fewer and fewer, but always larger and larger values of hourly wage in the data. You have seen this shape of a distribution in the tutorial for chapter 2 already! Do you remember the name of this particular shape of a distribution? (why not type ScPoEconometrics::runTutorial(‘chapter2’)) to check? Let’s run a first regression on this data to generate some intution: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{wage}_i = b_0 + b_1 \\text{educ}_i + e_i \\tag{3.15} \\end{equation}\\] We use the lm function for this purpose as follows: hourly_wage &lt;- lm(formula = wage ~ educ, data = wage1) and we can add the resulting regression line to our above plot: plotfun(wage1) abline(hourly_wage, col = &#39;black&#39;, lw = 2) # add regression line Figure 3.6: Wages vs Education from the wooldridge dataset wage1, with regression The hourly_wage object contains the results of this estimation. We can get a summary of those results with the summary method: summary(hourly_wage) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = wage ~ educ, data = wage1) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -5.3396 -2.1501 -0.9674 1.1921 16.6085 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

(row named educ) For example, for 15 years of education, we predict roughly -0.9 + 0.541 * 15 = 7.215 dollars/h. 3.8 Scaling Regressions Regression estimates (\\(b_0, b_1\\)) are in the scale of the data. The actual value of the estimates will vary, if we change the scale of the data. The overall fit of the model to the data would not change, however, so that the \\(R^2\\) statistic would be constant. Suppose we wanted to use the above estimates to report the effect of years of education on annual wages instead of hourly ones. Let’s assume we have full-time workers, 7h per day, 5 days per week, 45 weeks per year. Calling this factor \\(\\delta = 7 \\times 5 \\times 45 = 1575\\), we have that \\(x\\) dollars per hour imply \\(x \\times \\delta = x \\times 1575\\) dollars per year. What would be the effect of using \\(\\tilde{y} = wage \\times 1575\\) instead of \\(y = wage\\) as outcome variable on our regression coefficients \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\)? Well, let’s try! Effect of Scaling on Coefficients Dependent variable: wage annual_wage (1) (2) educ 0.541*** 852.641*** (0.053) (83.866) Constant -0.905 -1,425.141 (0.685) (1,078.824) Observations 526 526 R2 0.165 0.165 Adjusted R2 0.163 0.163 Residual Std. Error (df = 524) 3.378 5,320.963 F Statistic (df = 1; 524) 103.363*** 103.363*** Note: p&lt;0.1; p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01 Let’s call the coefficients in the column labelled (1) as \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), and let’s call the ones in column (2) \\(b_0^*\\) and \\(b_1^*\\). In column (1) we see that another year increaeses hourly wage by 0.54 dollars, as before. In column (2), the corresponding number is 852.64, i.e. another year of education will increase annual wages by 852.64 dollars, on average. Notice however, that \\(b_0 \\times \\delta = -0.9 \\times 1575 = -1425.14 = b_0^*\\) and that \\(b_1 \\times \\delta = 0.54 \\times 1575 = 852.64 = b_1^*\\), that is we just had to multiply both coefficients by the scaling factor applied to original outcome \\(y\\) to obtain our new coefficients \\(b_0^*\\) and \\(b_1^*\\)! Also, observe that the \\(R^2\\)s of both regressions are identical! So, really, we did not have to run the regression in column (2) at all to make this change: multiplying all coefficients through by \\(\\delta\\) is enough in this case. We keep the identically same fit to the data. Rescaling the regressors \\(x\\) is slightly different, but it’s easy to work out how different, given the linear nature of the covariance operator, which is part of the OLS estimator. Suppose we rescale \\(x\\) by the number \\(c\\). Then, using the OLS formula in (3.5), we see that we get new slope coefficient \\(b_1^*\\) via \\[\\begin{align} b_1^* &amp;= \\frac{Cov(cx,y)}{Var(cx)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{cCov(x,y)}{c^2 Var(x)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{c} b_1. \\end{align}\\] As for the intercept, and by using (3.6) \\[\\begin{align} b_0^* &amp;= \\bar{y} - b_1^* \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N c \\cdot x_i \\\\ &amp;= \\bar{y} - b_1^* \\frac{c}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i \\\\ &amp;= \\bar{y} - \\frac{1}{c} b_1 c * \\bar{x} \\\\ &amp;= \\bar{y} - b_1 * \\bar{x} \\\\ &amp;= b_0 \\end{align}\\] That is, we change the slope by the inverse of the scaling factor applied to regressor \\(x\\), but the intercept is unaffected from this. You should play around for a while with our rescaling app to get a feeling for this: library(ScPoEconometrics) launchApp(&#39;Rescale&#39;) 3.9 A Particular Rescaling: The \\(\\log\\) Transform The natural logarithm is a particularly important transformation that we often encounter in economics. Why would we transform a variable with the \\(\\log\\) function to start with? Several important economic variables (like wages, city size, firm size, etc) are approximately log-normally distributed. By transforming them with the \\(\\log\\), we obtain an approximately normally distributed variable, which has desirable properties for our regression. Applying the \\(\\log\\) reduces the impact of outliers. The transformation allows for a convenient interpretation in terms of percentage changes of the outcome variable. Let’s investigate this issue in our running example by transforming the wage data above. Look back at the bottom panel of figure 3.5: Of course you saw immediately that this looked a lot like a log-normal distribution, so point 1. above applies. We modify the left hand side of equation (3.15): \\[\\begin{equation} \\log(\\text{wage}_i) = b_0 + b_1 \\text{educ}_i + e_i \\tag{3.16} \\end{equation}\\] Let’s use the update function to modify our previous regression model: log_hourly_wage = update(hourly_wage, log(wage) ~ ., data = wage1) The update function takes an existing lm object, like hourly_wage here, and updates the formula. Here the . on the right hand side means leave unchanged (so the RHS stays unchanged). How do our pictures change? par(mfrow = c(1,2)) plotfun(wage1,rug = FALSE) abline(hourly_wage, col = &#39;black&#39;, lw = 2) # add regression line plotfun(wage1,log = TRUE, rug = FALSE) abline(log_hourly_wage, col = &#39;black&#39;, lw = 2) # add regression line par(mfrow = c(1,1)) It looks as if the regression line has the same slope, but beware of the different scales of the y-axis! You can clearly see that all y-values have been compressed by the log transformation. The log case behaves differently from our scaling by a constant number case above because it is a nonlinear function. Let’s compare the output between both models: Log Transformed Equation Dependent variable: wage log(wage) (1) (2) educ 0.541*** 0.083*** (0.053) (0.008) Constant -0.905 0.584*** (0.685) (0.097) Observations 526 526 R2 0.165 0.186 Adjusted R2 0.163 0.184 Residual Std. Error (df = 524) 3.378 0.480 F Statistic (df = 1; 524) 103.363*** 119.582*** Note: p&lt;0.1; p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01 The interpretation of the transformed model in column (2) is now the following: We call a regression of the form \\(\\log(y) = b_0 + b_1 x + u\\) a log-level specification, because we regressed the log of a variable on the level (i.e not the log!) of another variable. Here, the impact of increasing \\(x\\) by one unit is to increase \\(y\\) by \\(100 \\times b_1\\) percent. In our example: an additional year of education will increase hourly wages by 8.3%. Notice that this is very different from saying …increases log hourly wages by 8.3%, which is wrong. Notice that the \\(R^2\\) slightly improved, so have a better fit to the data. This is due the fact that the log compressed large outlier values. Whether we apply the \\(log\\) to left or right-hand side variables makes a difference, as outlined in this important table: Table 3.1: Common Regression Specifications Specification Outcome Var Regressor Interpretation of \\(b_1\\) Comment Level-level y x \\(\\Delta y = b_1 \\Delta x\\) Standard Level-log y \\(\\log(x)\\) \\(\\Delta y = \\frac{b_1}{100} \\Delta x\\) less frequent Log-level \\(\\log(y)\\) x \\(\\% \\Delta y = (100 b_1) \\Delta\\) x Semi-elasticity Log-Log \\(\\log(y)\\) \\(\\log(x)\\) \\(\\% \\Delta y = \\% \\Delta\\) b_1 x Elasticity You may remember from your introductory micro course what the definition of the elasticity of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is: This number tells us by how many percent \\(y\\) will change, if we change \\(x\\) by one percent. Let’s look at another example from the wooldridge package of datasets, this time concerning CEO salaries and their relationship with company sales. data(&quot;ceosal1&quot;, package = &quot;wooldridge&quot;) par(mfrow = c(1,2)) plot(salary ~ sales, data = ceosal1, main = &quot;Sales vs Salaries&quot;,xaxt = &quot;n&quot;,frame = FALSE) axis(1, at = c(0,40000, 80000)) rug(ceosal1$salary,side = 2) rug(ceosal1$sales,side = 1) plot(log(salary) ~ log(sales), data = ceosal1, main = &quot;Log(Sales) vs Log(Salaries)&quot;) Figure 3.7: The effect of log-transforming highly skewed data. In the left panel of figure 3.7 you clearly see that both sales and salary have very long right tails, as indicated by the rug plots on either axis. As a consequence, the points are clustered in the bottom left corner of the plot. We suspect a positive relationship, but it’s hard to see. Contrast this with the right panel, where both axis have been log transformed: the points are nicely spread out, clearly spelling out a positive correlation. Let’s see what this gives in a regression model! \\[ \\text{logsalary} = 4.82 + 0.26(\\text{logsales}) + \\epsilon \\] Refering back at table 3.1, here we have a log-log specification. Therefore we interpret this regression as follows: In a log-log equation, the slope coefficient \\(b_1\\) is the elasticity of \\(y\\) with respect to changes in \\(x\\). Here: A 1% increase in sales is associated to a 0.26% increase in CEO salaries. Note, again, that there is no log in this statement. This slope is related to the angle between vectors \\(\\mathbf{a} = (\\overline{x},\\overline{y})\\), and \\(\\mathbf{b} = (\\overline{x},0)\\). Hence, it’s related to the scalar projection of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).↩ This example is close to the vignette of the wooldridge package, whose author I hereby thank for the excellent work.↩ "],
["multiple-reg.html", "Chapter 4 Multiple Regression 4.1 All Else Equal 4.2 Multicolinearity 4.3 Log Wage Equation 4.4 How To Make Predictions", " Chapter 4 Multiple Regression We can extend the discussion from chapter 3 to more than one explanatory variable. For example, suppose that instead of only \\(x\\) we now had \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) in order to explain \\(y\\). Everything we’ve learned for the single variable case applies here as well. Instead of a regression line, we now get a regression plane, i.e. an object representable in 3 dimenions: \\((x_1,x_2,y)\\). As an example, suppose we wanted to explain how many miles per gallon (mpg) a car can travel as a function of its horse power (hp) and its weight (wt). In other words we want to estimate the equation \\[\\begin{equation} mpg_i = b_0 + b_1 hp_i + b_2 wt_i + e_i \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] on our built-in dataset of cars (mtcars): head(subset(mtcars, select = c(mpg,hp,wt))) #OUT&gt; mpg hp wt #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 21.0 110 2.620 #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 110 2.875 #OUT&gt; Datsun 710 22.8 93 2.320 #OUT&gt; Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 110 3.215 #OUT&gt; Hornet Sportabout 18.7 175 3.440 #OUT&gt; Valiant 18.1 105 3.460 How do you think hp and wt will influence how many miles per gallon of gasoline each of those cars can travel? In other words, what do you expect the signs of \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) to be? With two explanatory variables as here, it is still possible to visualize the regression plane, so let’s start with this as an answer. The OLS regression plane through this dataset looks like in figure 4.1: Figure 4.1: Multiple Regression - a plane in 3D. The red lines indicate the residual for each observation. This visualization shows a couple of things: the data are shown with red points and the grey plane is the one resulting from OLS estimation of equation (4.1). You should realize that this is exactly the same story as told in figure 3.1 - just in three dimensions! Furthermore, multiple regression refers the fact that there could be more than two regressors. In fact, you could in principle have \\(K\\) regressors, and our theory developed so far would still be valid: \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{y}_i &amp;= b_0 + b_1 x_{1i} + b_2 x_{2i} + \\dots + b_K x_{Ki}\\\\ e_i &amp;= y_i - \\hat{y}_i \\tag{4.2} \\end{align}\\] Just as before, the least squares method chooses numbers \\((b_0,b_1,\\dots,b_K)\\) to as to minimize SSR, exactly as in the minimization problem for the one regressor case seen in (3.4). 4.1 All Else Equal We can see from the above plot that cars with more horse power and greater weight, in general travel fewer miles per gallon of combustible. Hence, we observe a plane that is downward sloping in both the weight and horse power directions. Suppose now we wanted to know impact of hp on mpg in isolation, so as if we could ask Keeping the value of \\(wt\\) fixed for a certain car, what would be the impact on \\(mpg\\) be if we were to increase only its \\(hp\\)? Put differently, keeping all else equal, what’s the impact of changing \\(hp\\) on \\(mpg\\)? We ask this kind of question all the time in econometrics. In figure 4.1 you clearly see that both explanatory variables have a negative impact on the outcome of interest: as one increases either the horse power or the weight of a car, one finds that miles per gallon decreases. What is kind of hard to read off is how negative an impact each variable has in isolation. As a matter of fact, the kind of question asked here is so common that it has got its own name: we’d say “ceteris paribus, what is the impact of hp on mpg?”. ceteris paribus is latin and means the others equal, i.e. all other variables fixed. In terms of our model in (4.1), we want to know the following quantity: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial mpg_i}{\\partial hp_i} = b_1 \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] The \\(\\partial\\) sign denotes a partial derivative of the function describing mpg with respect to the variable hp. It measures how the value of mpg changes, as we change the value of hp ever so slightly. In our context, this means: keeping all other variables fixed, what is the effect of hp on mpg?. We call the value of coefficient \\(b_1\\) therefore also the partial effect of hp on mpg. In terms of our dataset, we use R to run the following multiple regression: #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -3.941 -1.600 -0.182 1.050 5.854 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) #OUT&gt; (Intercept) 37.22727 1.59879 23.285 &lt; 2e-16 *** #OUT&gt; wt -3.87783 0.63273 -6.129 1.12e-06 *** #OUT&gt; hp -0.03177 0.00903 -3.519 0.00145 ** #OUT&gt; --- #OUT&gt; Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residual standard error: 2.593 on 29 degrees of freedom #OUT&gt; Multiple R-squared: 0.8268, Adjusted R-squared: 0.8148 #OUT&gt; F-statistic: 69.21 on 2 and 29 DF, p-value: 9.109e-12 From this table you see that the coefficient on wt has value -3.87783. You can interpret this as follows: Holding all other variables fixed at their observed values - or ceteris paribus - a one unit increase in \\(wt\\) implies a -3.87783 units change in \\(mpg\\). In other words, increasing the weight of a car by 1000 pounds (lbs), will lead to 3.88 miles less travelled per gallon. Similarly, a car with one additional horse power means that we will travel 0.03177 fewer miles per gallon of gasoline, all else (i.e. \\(wt\\)) equal. 4.2 Multicolinearity One important requirement for multiple regression is that the data be not linearly dependent: Each variable should provide at least some new information for the outcome, and it cannot be replicated as a linear combination of other variables. Suppose that in the example above, we had a variable wtplus defined as wt + 1, and we included this new variable together with wt in our regression. In this case, wtplus provides no new information. It’s enough to know \\(wt\\), and add \\(1\\) to it. In this sense, wt_plus is a redundant variable and should not be included in the model. Notice that this holds only for linearly dependent variables - nonlinear transformations (like for example \\(wt^2\\)) are exempt from this rule. Here is why: \\[\\begin{align} y &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\text{wt} + b_2 \\text{wtplus} + e \\\\ &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\text{wt} + b_2 (\\text{wt} + 1) + e \\\\ &amp;= (b_0 + b_2) + \\text{wt} (b_1 + b_2) + e \\end{align}\\] This shows that we cannot identify the regression coefficients in case of linearly dependent data. Variation in the variable wt identifies a different coefficient, say \\(\\gamma = b_1 + b_2\\), from what we actually wanted: separate estimates for \\(b_1,b_2\\). We cannot have variables which are linearly dependent, or perfectly colinear. This is known as the rank condition. In particular, the condition dictates that we need at least \\(N \\geq K+1\\), i.e. more observations than coefficients. The greater the degree of linear dependence amongst our explanatory variables, the less information we can extract from them, and our estimates becomes less precise. 4.3 Log Wage Equation Let’s go back to our previous example of the relationship between log wages and education. How does this relationship change if we also think that experience in the labor market has an impact, next to years of education? Here is a picture: Figure 4.2: Log wages vs education and experience in 3D. Let’s add even more variables! For instance, what’s the impact of experience in the labor market, and time spent with the current employer? Let’s first look at how those variables co-vary with each other: cmat = round(cor(subset(wage1,select = c(lwage,educ,exper,tenure))),2) # correlation matrix corrplot::corrplot(cmat,type = &quot;upper&quot;,method = &quot;ellipse&quot;) Figure 4.3: correlation plot The way to read the so-called correlation plot in figure 4.3 is straightforward: each row illustrates the correlation of a certain variable with the other variables. In this example both the shape of the ellipse in each cell as well as their color coding tell us how strongly two variables correlate. Let us put this into a regression model now: educ_only &lt;- lm(lwage ~ educ , data = wage1) educ_exper &lt;- lm(lwage ~ educ + exper , data = wage1) log_wages &lt;- lm(lwage ~ educ + exper + tenure, data = wage1) stargazer::stargazer(educ_only, educ_exper, log_wages,type = if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) &quot;latex&quot; else &quot;html&quot;) Dependent variable: lwage (1) (2) (3) educ 0.083*** 0.098*** 0.092*** (0.008) (0.008) (0.007) exper 0.010*** 0.004** (0.002) (0.002) tenure 0.022*** (0.003) Constant 0.584*** 0.217** 0.284*** (0.097) (0.109) (0.104) Observations 526 526 526 R2 0.186 0.249 0.316 Adjusted R2 0.184 0.246 0.312 Residual Std. Error 0.480 (df = 524) 0.461 (df = 523) 0.441 (df = 522) F Statistic 119.582*** (df = 1; 524) 86.862*** (df = 2; 523) 80.391*** (df = 3; 522) Note: p&lt;0.1; p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01 Column (1) refers to model (3.16) from the previous chapter, where we only had educ as a regressor: we obtain an \\(R^2\\) of 0.186. Column (2) is the model that generated the plane in figure 4.2 above. (3) is the model with three regressors. You can see that by adding more regressors, the quality of our fit increases, as more of the variation in \\(y\\) is now accounted for by our model. You can also see that the values of our estimated coefficients keeps changing as we move from left to right across the columns. Given the correlation structure shown in figure 4.3, it is only natural that this is happening: We see that educ and exper are negatively correlated, for example. So, if we omit exper from the model in column (1), educ will reflect part of this correlation with exper by a lower estimated value. By directly controlling for exper in column (2) we get an estimate of the effect of educ net of whatever effect exper has in isolation on the outcome variable. We will come back to this point later on. 4.4 How To Make Predictions So suppose we have a model like \\[\\text{lwage} = b_0 + b_{1}(\\text{educ}) + b_{2}(\\text{exper}) + b_{3}(\\text{tenure}) + \\epsilon\\] How could we use this to make a prediction of log wages, given some new data? Remember that the OLS procedure gives us estimates for the values \\(b_0,b_1, b_2,b_3\\). With those in hand, it is straightforward to make a prediction about the conditional mean of the outcome - just plug in the desired numbers for educ,exper and tenure. Suppose you want to know what the mean of lwage is conditional on educ = 10,exper=4 and tenure = 2. You’d do \\[\\begin{align} E[\\text{lwage}|\\text{educ}=10,\\text{exper}=4,\\text{tenure}=2] &amp;= b_0 + b_1 10 + b_2 4 + b_3 2\\\\ &amp;= 1.27. \\end{align}\\] I computed the last line directly with x = c(1,10,4,2) # 1 for intercept pred = coef(log_wages) %*% x but R has a more complete prediction interface, using the function predict. For starters, you can predict the model on all data points which were contained in the dataset we used for estimation, i.e. wage1 in our case: head(predict(log_wages)) # first 6 observations of wage1 as predicted by our model #OUT&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 6 #OUT&gt; 1.304921 1.523506 1.304921 1.819802 1.461690 1.970451 Often you want to add that prediction to the original dataset: wage_prediction = cbind(wage1, prediction = predict(log_wages)) head(wage_prediction[, c(&quot;lwage&quot;,&quot;educ&quot;,&quot;exper&quot;,&quot;tenure&quot;,&quot;prediction&quot;)]) #OUT&gt; lwage educ exper tenure prediction #OUT&gt; 1 1.131402 11 2 0 1.304921 #OUT&gt; 2 1.175573 12 22 2 1.523506 #OUT&gt; 3 1.098612 11 2 0 1.304921 #OUT&gt; 4 1.791759 8 44 28 1.819802 #OUT&gt; 5 1.667707 12 7 2 1.461690 #OUT&gt; 6 2.169054 16 9 8 1.970451 You’ll remember that we called the distance in prediction and observed outcome our residual \\(e\\). Well here this is just lwage - prediction. Indeed, \\(e\\) is such an important quantity that R has a convenient method to compute \\(y - \\hat{y}\\) from an lm object directly - the method resid. Let’s add another column to wage_prediction: wage_prediction = cbind(wage_prediction, residual = resid(log_wages)) head(wage_prediction[, c(&quot;lwage&quot;,&quot;educ&quot;,&quot;exper&quot;,&quot;tenure&quot;,&quot;prediction&quot;,&quot;residual&quot;)]) #OUT&gt; lwage educ exper tenure prediction residual #OUT&gt; 1 1.131402 11 2 0 1.304921 -0.17351850 #OUT&gt; 2 1.175573 12 22 2 1.523506 -0.34793289 #OUT&gt; 3 1.098612 11 2 0 1.304921 -0.20630832 #OUT&gt; 4 1.791759 8 44 28 1.819802 -0.02804286 #OUT&gt; 5 1.667707 12 7 2 1.461690 0.20601725 #OUT&gt; 6 2.169054 16 9 8 1.970451 0.19860271 Using the data in wage_prediction, you should now check for yourself what we already know about \\(\\hat{y}\\) and \\(e\\) from section 3.3: What is the average of the vector residual? What is the average of prediction? How does this compare to the average of the outcome lwage? What is the correlation between prediction and residual? "],
["categorical-vars.html", "Chapter 5 Categorial Variables 5.1 The Binary Regressor Case 5.2 Dummy and Continuous Variables 5.3 Categorical Variables in R: factor 5.4 Interactions 5.5 (Unobserved) Individual Heterogeneity", " Chapter 5 Categorial Variables Up until now, we have encountered only examples with continuous variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), that is, \\(x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), so that a typical observation could have been \\((y_i,x_i) = (1.5,5.62)\\). There are many situations where it makes sense to think about the data in terms of categories, rather than continuous numbers. For example, whether an observation \\(i\\) is male or female, whether a pixel on a screen is black or white, and whether a good was produced in France, Germany, Italy, China or Spain are all categorical classifications of data. Probably the simplest type of categorical variable is the binary, boolean, or just dummy variable. As the name suggests, it can take on only two values, 0 and 1, or TRUE and FALSE. 5.1 The Binary Regressor Case Even though this is an extremely parsimonious way of encoding that, it is a very powerful tool that allows us to represent that a certain observation \\(i\\) is a member of a certain category \\(j\\). For example, let’s imagine we have income data on males and females, and we would create a variable called is.male that is TRUE whenever \\(i\\) is male, FALSE otherwise, and similarly for women. For example, to encode whether subject \\(i\\) is male, one could do this: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{is.male}_i &amp;= \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is male} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is not male}. \\\\ \\end{cases}, \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] and similarly for females, we’d have \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{is.female}_i &amp;= \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is female} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is not female}. \\\\ \\end{cases} \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] By definition, we have just introduced a linear dependence into our dataset. It will always be true that \\(\\text{is.male}_i + \\text{is.female}_i = 1\\). This is because dummy variables are based on data being mutually exclusively categorized - here, you are either male or female.5 This should immediately remind you of section 4.2 where we introduced multicolinearity. A regression of income on both of our variables like this \\[ y_i = b_0 + b_1 \\text{is.female}_i + b_2 \\text{is.male}_i + e_i \\] would be invalid because of perfect colinearity between \\(\\text{is.female}_i\\) and \\(\\text{is.male}_i\\). The solution to this is pragmatic and simple: In dummy variable regressions, we remove one category from the regression (for example here: is.male) and call it the reference category. The effect of being male is absorbed in the intercept. The coefficient on the remaining categories measures the difference in mean outcome with respect to the reference category. Now let’s try this out. We start by creating the female indicator as above, \\[ \\text{is.female}_i = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is female} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is not female}. \\\\ \\end{cases} \\] and let’s suppose that \\(y_i\\) is a measure of \\(i\\)’s annual labor income. Our model is \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = b_0 + b_1 \\text{is.female}_i + e_i \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] and here is how we estimate this in R: # x = sample(x = c(0, 1), size = n, replace = T) dta$is.female = factor(x) # convert x to factor dummy_reg = lm(y~is.female,dta) summary(dummy_reg) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = y ~ is.female, data = dta) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -2.4253 -0.6551 0.1321 0.7217 2.8129 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

Also interesting is that \\(b_1\\) is equal to the difference in conditional means between male and female \\[b_1 = E[y|\\text{is.female}=1] - E[y|\\text{is.female}=0]=-3.0169.\\] A dummy variable measures the difference or the offset in the mean of the response variable, \\(E[y]\\), conditional on \\(x\\) belonging to some category - relative to a baseline category. In our artificial example, the coefficient \\(b_1\\) informs us that women earn on average 3.756 units less than men. It is instructive to reconsider this example graphically: Figure 5.1: regressing \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) on \\(\\text{is.female}_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). The blue line is \\(E[y]\\), the red arrow is the size of \\(b_1\\). Which is the same as the slope of the regression line in this case and the difference in conditional means! In figure 5.1 we see that this regression simplifies to the straight line connecting the mean, or the expected value of \\(y\\) when \\(\\text{is.female}_i = 0\\), i.e. \\(E[y|\\text{is.female}_i=0]\\), to the mean when \\(\\text{is.female}_i=1\\), i.e. \\(E[y|\\text{is.female}_i=1]\\). It is useful to remember that the unconditional mean of \\(y\\), i.e. \\(E[y]\\), is going to be the result of regressing \\(y\\) only on an intercept, illustrated by the blue line. This line will always lie in between both conditional means. As indicated by the red arrow, the estimate of the coefficient on the dummy, \\(b_1\\), is equal to the difference in conditional means for both groups. You should look at our app now to deepen your understanding of what’s going on here: library(ScPoEconometrics) launchApp(&quot;reg_dummy&quot;) 5.2 Dummy and Continuous Variables What happens if there are more predictors than just the dummy variable in a regression? For example, what if instead we had \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = b_0 + b_1 \\text{is.female}_i + b_2 \\text{exper}_i + e_i \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\text{exper}_i\\) would measure years of experience in the labor market? As above, the dummy variable acts as an intercept shifter. We have \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = \\begin{cases} b_0 + b_1 + b_2 \\times \\text{exper}_i + e_i &amp; \\text{if is.female=1} \\\\ b_0 + \\hphantom{b_1} +b_2 \\times \\text{exper}_i + e_i &amp; \\text{if is.female=0} \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] so that the intercept is \\(b_0 + b_1\\) for women but \\(b_0\\) for men. We will see this in the real-world example below, but for now let’s see the effect of switching the dummy on and off in this app: library(ScPoEconometrics) launchApp(&quot;reg_dummy_example&quot;) 5.3 Categorical Variables in R: factor R has extensive support for categorical variables built-in. The relevant data type representing a categorical variable is called factor. We encountered them as basic data types in section 1.8 already, but it is worth repeating this here. We have seen that a factor categorizes a usually small number of numeric values by labels, as in this example which is similar to what I used to create regressor is.female for the above regression: is.female = factor(x = c(0,1,1,0), labels = c(FALSE,TRUE)) is.female #OUT&gt; [1] FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE #OUT&gt; Levels: FALSE TRUE You can see the result is a vector object of type factor with 4 entries, whereby 0 is represented as FALSE and 1 as TRUE. An other example could be if we wanted to record a variable sex instead, and we could do sex = factor(x = c(0,1,1,0), labels = c(&quot;male&quot;,&quot;female&quot;)) sex #OUT&gt; [1] male female female male #OUT&gt; Levels: male female You can see that this is almost identical, just the labels are different. 5.3.1 More Levels We can go beyond binary categorical variables such as TRUE vs FALSE. For example, suppose that \\(x\\) measures educational attainment, i.e. it is now something like \\(x_i \\in \\{\\text{high school,some college,BA,MSc}\\}\\). In R parlance, high school, some college, BA, MSc are the levels of factor \\(x\\). A straightforward extension of the above would dictate to create one dummy variable for each category (or level), like \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{has.HS}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{high school}] \\\\ \\text{has.someCol}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{some college}] \\\\ \\text{has.BA}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{BA}] \\\\ \\text{has.MSc}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{MSc}] \\end{align*}\\] but you can see that this is cumbersome. There is a better solution for us available: factor(x = c(1,1,2,4,3,4),labels = c(&quot;HS&quot;,&quot;someCol&quot;,&quot;BA&quot;,&quot;MSc&quot;)) #OUT&gt; [1] HS HS someCol MSc BA MSc #OUT&gt; Levels: HS someCol BA MSc Notice here that R will apply the labels in increasing order the way you supplied it (i.e. a numerical value 4 will correspond to “MSc”, no matter the ordering in x.) 5.3.2 Log Wages and Dummies The above developed factor terminology fits neatly into R’s linear model fitting framework. Let us illustrate the simplest use by way of example. Going back to our wage example, let’s say that a worker’s wage depends on their education as well as their sex: \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln w_i = b_0 + b_1 educ_i + b_2 female_i + e_i \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] data(&quot;wage1&quot;, package = &quot;wooldridge&quot;) wage1$female = as.factor(wage1$female) # convert 0-1 to factor lm_w = lm(lwage ~ educ, data = wage1) lm_w_sex = lm(lwage ~ educ + female, data = wage1) stargazer::stargazer(lm_w,lm_w_sex,type = if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) &quot;latex&quot; else &quot;html&quot;) Dependent variable: lwage (1) (2) educ 0.083*** 0.077*** (0.008) (0.007) female1 -0.361*** (0.039) Constant 0.584*** 0.826*** (0.097) (0.094) Observations 526 526 R2 0.186 0.300 Adjusted R2 0.184 0.298 Residual Std. Error 0.480 (df = 524) 0.445 (df = 523) F Statistic 119.582*** (df = 1; 524) 112.189*** (df = 2; 523) Note: p&lt;0.1; p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01 We know the results from column (1) very well by now. How does the relationship change if we include the female indicator? Remember from above that female is a factor with two levels, 0 and 1, where 1 means that’s a female. We see in the above output that R included a regressor called female1. This is a combination of the variable name female and the level which was included in the regression. In other words, R chooses a reference category (by default the first of all levels by order of appearance), which is excluded - here this is female==0. The interpretation is that \\(b_2\\) measures the effect of being female relative to being male. R automatically creates a dummy variable for each potential level, excluding the first category. Figure 5.2: log wage vs educ. Right panel with female dummy. Figure 5.2 illustrates this. The left panel is our previous model. The right panel adds the female dummy. You can see that both male and female have the same upward sloping regression line. But you can also see that there is a parallel downward shift from male to female line. The estimate of \\(b_2 = -0.36\\) is the size of the downward shift. 5.4 Interactions Sometimes it is useful to let the slope of a certain variable to be dependent on the value of another regressor. For example consider a model for the sales prices of houses, where area is the livable surface of the property, and age is its age: \\[\\begin{equation} \\log(price) = b_0 + b_1 \\text{area} + b_2 \\text{age} + b_3 (\\text{area} \\times \\text{age}) + e \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] In that model, the partial effect of area on log(price), keeping all other variables fixed, is \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial \\log(price)}{\\partial \\text{area}} = b_1 + b_3 (\\text{age}) \\end{equation}\\] If we find that \\(b_3 &gt; 0\\) in a regression, we conclude that the size of a house values more in older houses. We call \\(b_3\\) the interaction effect between area and age. Let’s look at that regression model now. data(hprice3, package = &quot;wooldridge&quot;) summary(lm(lprice ~ area*age, data = hprice3)) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = lprice ~ area * age, data = hprice3) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -1.27226 -0.16538 -0.00298 0.20673 0.83985 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) #OUT&gt; (Intercept) 1.071e+01 6.633e-02 161.448 &lt; 2e-16 *** #OUT&gt; area 3.647e-04 2.875e-05 12.686 &lt; 2e-16 *** #OUT&gt; age -7.377e-03 1.358e-03 -5.434 1.1e-07 *** #OUT&gt; area:age 9.168e-07 4.898e-07 1.872 0.0622 . #OUT&gt; --- #OUT&gt; Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residual standard error: 0.2925 on 317 degrees of freedom #OUT&gt; Multiple R-squared: 0.5586, Adjusted R-squared: 0.5545 #OUT&gt; F-statistic: 133.7 on 3 and 317 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16 In this instance, we see that indeed there is a small positive interaction between area and age on the sales price: even though age in isolation decreases the sales value, bigger houses command a small premium if they are older. 5.4.1 Interactions with Dummies: Differential Slopes It is straightforward to extend the interactions logic to allow not only for different intercepts, but also different slopes for each subgroup in a dataset. Let’s go back to our dataset of wages from section 5.3.2 above. Now that we know how to create and interaction between two variables, we can easily modify equation (5.3) like this: \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln w = b_0 + b_1 \\text{female} + b_2 \\text{educ} + b_3 (\\text{female} \\times \\text{educ}) + e \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] The only peculiarity here is that female is a factor with levels 0 and 1: i.e. the interaction term \\(b_3\\) will be zero for all men. Similarly to above, we can test whether there are indeed different returns to education or men and women by looking at the estimated value \\(b_3\\): lm_w_interact &lt;- lm(lwage ~ educ * female , data = wage1) # R expands to full interactions model summary(lm_w_interact) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = lwage ~ educ * female, data = wage1) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -2.02673 -0.27468 -0.03721 0.26221 1.34740 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

This is easy to verify visually in this plot, where we are unable to detect a difference in slopes in the right panel. Figure 5.3: log wage vs educ. Right panel allows slopes to be different - turns out they are not! 5.5 (Unobserved) Individual Heterogeneity Finally, dummary variables are sometimes very important to account for spurious relationships in that data. Consider the following (artificial example): Suppose we collected data on hourly wage data together with a the number of hours worked for a set of individuals. We plot want to investigate labour supply behaviour of those individuals, hence we run regression hours_worked ~ wage. We expect to get a positive coefficient on wage: the higher the wage, the more hours worked. You know that individuals are members of either group g=0 or g=1. Here we observe a slightly negative relationship: higher wages are associated with fewer hours worked? Maybe. But what is this, there is a group identifier in this data! Let’s use this and include g as a dummy in the regression - suppose g encodes male and female. Figure 5.4: Left and right panel exhibit the same data. The right panel controls for group composition. This is an artificial example; yet it shows that you can be severly misled if you don’t account for group-specific effects in your data. The problem is particularly accute if we don’t know group membership - we can then resort to advanced methods that are beyond the scope of this course to estimate which group each individual belongs to. If we do know group membership, however, it is good practice to include a group dummy so as to control for group effects. There are transgender individuals where this example will not apply.↩ "],

What are Statistical Models? 6.6 The Classical Regression Model (CRM) 6.7 Standard Errors in Theory", " Chapter 6 Regression Inference In this chapter we want to investigate uncertainty in regression estimates. We want to understand what the precise meaning of the Std. Error column in a typical regression table is telling us. In terms of a picture, we want to understand better the meaning of the shaded area as in this one here: Figure 6.1: Confidence bands around a regression line. In order to fully understand this, we need to go back and make sure we have a good grasp of sampling. Let’s do this first. 6.1 Sampling In class we were confronted with a jar of Tricolore Fusilli pasta as picture in figure 6.2.6 We asked ourselves a question which, secretly, many of you had asked themselves at one point in their lives, namely: What is the proportion of green Fusilli in a pack of Tricolore Fusilli? Well, it’s time to find out. Figure 6.2: A glass jar filled with Fusilli pasta in three different colors. Let’s call the fusilly in this jar our study population, i.e. the set of units about which we want to learn something. There are several approaches to address the question of how big a proportion in the population the green Fusilli make up. One obvious solution is to enumerate all Fusilli according to their color, and compute their proportion in the entire population. It works perfectly well as a solution, but is a long and arduous process, see figures 6.3 and 6.4. Figure 6.3: Manually separating Fusilli by their color is very costly in terms of effort and cost. Additionally, you may draw worried looks from the people around you, while you are doing it. Maybe this is not the right way to approach this task?7 Figure 6.4: Heaps of Fusilli pasta ready to be counted. 6.1.1 Taking One Sample From the Population We started by randomly grabbing a handful of Fusilli from the jar and by letting drop exactly \\(N=20\\) into a paper coffee cup, pictured in 6.5. We call \\(N\\) the sample size. The count and corresponding proportions of each color in this first sample are shown in the following table: Color Count Proportion Red 7 0.35 Green 5 0.25 White 8 0.4 So far, so good. We have our first estimate of the population proportion of green Fusilli in the overall population: 0.25. Notice that taking a sample of \\(N=20\\) was much quicker and much less painful than performing the full count (i.e. the census) of Fusilli performed above. Figure 6.5: Taking one sample of 20 Fusilli from the jar. Then, we put my sample back into the jar, and we reshuffled the Fusilli. Had we taken another sample, again of \\(N=20\\), would we again have gotten 7 Red, 5 Green, and 8 White, just as in the first sample? Maybe, but maybe not. Suppose we had carried on for several times drawing samples of 20 and counting the colors: Would we also have observed 5 green Fusilli? Definitely not. We would have noted some degree of variability in the proportions computed from our samples. The sample proportions in this case are an example of a sample statistic. Sampling Variation refers to the fact that if we randomly take samples from a wider population, the random composition of each sample will imply that we obtain statistics that vary - they take on potentially different values in each sample. Let’s see how this story evolved as we started taking more samples at a time. 6.2 Taking Eleven Samples From The Population We formed teams of two students in class who would each in turn take samples from the jar (the population) of size \\(N=20\\), as before. Each team computed the proportion of green Fusilli they had in their sample, and we wrote this data down in a table on the board. Then, we drew a histogram which showed how many samples had fallen into which bins. Figure 6.6: Taking eleven samples of 20 Fusilli each from the jar, and plotting the histogram of obtained sample proportions of Green Fusilli. We looked at the histogram in figure 6.6 and we noted several things: The largest proportions where 0.3 green The smallest proportion was 0.15 green. Most samples found a proportion of 0.25 green fusilli. We did think that this looked suspiciouly like a normal distribution. We collected the sample data into a data.frame: pasta_samples &lt;- data.frame(group = 1:11, replicate = 1:11, prop_green = c(0.3,0.25,0.25,0.3,0.15,0.3,0.25,0.25,0.2,0.25,0.2)) pasta_samples #OUT&gt; group replicate prop_green #OUT&gt; 1 1 1 0.30 #OUT&gt; 2 2 2 0.25 #OUT&gt; 3 3 3 0.25 #OUT&gt; 4 4 4 0.30 #OUT&gt; 5 5 5 0.15 #OUT&gt; 6 6 6 0.30 #OUT&gt; 7 7 7 0.25 #OUT&gt; 8 8 8 0.25 #OUT&gt; 9 9 9 0.20 #OUT&gt; 10 10 10 0.25 #OUT&gt; 11 11 11 0.20 This produces an associated histogram which looks very much like the one we draws onto the board: 6.2.1 Recap Let’s recaptiulate what we just did. We wanted to know what proportion of Fusilli in the glass jar in figure 6.2 are green. We acknowledged that an exclusive count, or a census, is a costly and cumbersome exercise, which in most circumstances we will try to avoid. In order to make some progress nonetheless, we took a random sample from the full population in the jar: we randomly selected 20 Fusilli, and looked at the proportion of green ones in there. We found a proportion of 0.25. After replacing the Fusilli from the first sample in the jar, we asked ourselves if, upon drawing a new sample of 20 Fusilli, we should expect to see the same outcome - and we concluded: maybe, but maybe not. In short, we discovered some random variation from sample to sample. We called this sampling variation. The purpose of this little activity was three-fold: To understand that random samples differ and that there is sampling variation. To understand that bigger samples will yield smaller sampling variation. To illustrate that the sampling distribution of any statistic (i.e. not only the sample proportion as in our case) computed from a random sample converges to a normal distribution as the sample size increases. The value of this exercise consisted in making you perform the sampling activity yourself. We will now hand over to the brilliant moderndive package, which will further develop this chapter. 6.3 Handover to Moderndive Figure 6.7: The Moderndive package used red and white balls instead of fusilli pasta. The sampling activity in moderndive was performed with red and white balls instead of green fusilli pasta. The rest is identical. We will now read sections 7.2 and 7.3 in their book, as well as chapter 8 on confidence intervals adn bootstrapping, and chapter 9 on hypothesis testing. 6.4 Uncertainty in Regression Estimates In the previous chapters we have seen how the OLS method can produce estimates about intercept and slope coefficients from data. You have seen this method at work in R by using the lm function as well. It is now time to introduce the notion that given that \\(b_0\\), \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are estimates of some unkown population parameters, there is some degree of uncertainty about their values. An other way to say this is that we want some indication about the precision of those estimates. The underlying issue that the data we have at hand are usually samples from a larger population. How confident should we be about the estimated values \\(b\\)? 6.5 What is true? What are Statistical Models? A statistical model is simply a set of assumptions about how some data have been generated. As such, it models the data-generating process (DGP), as we have it in mind. Once we define a DGP, we could simulate data from it and see how this compares to the data we observe in the real world. Or, we could change the parameters of the DGP so as to understand how the real world data would change, could we (or some policy) change the corresponding parameters in reality. Let us now consider one particular statistical model, which in fact we have seen so many times already. 6.6 The Classical Regression Model (CRM) Let’s bring back our simple model (3.3) to explain this concept. \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] The smallest set of assumptions used to define the classical regression model as in (6.1) are the following: The data are not linearly dependent: Each variable provides new information for the outcome, and it cannot be replicated as a linear combination of other variables. We have seen this in section 4.2. In the particular case of one regressor, as here, we require that \\(x\\) exhibit some variation in the data, i.e. \\(Var(x)\\neq 0\\). The mean of the residuals conditional on \\(x\\) should be zero, \\(E[\\varepsilon|x] = 0\\). Notice that this also means that \\(Cov(\\varepsilon,x) = 0\\), i.e. that the errors and our explanatory variable(s) should be uncorrelated. It is said that \\(x\\) should be strictly exogenous to the model. These assumptions are necessary to successfully (and correctly!) run an OLS regression. They are often supplemented with an additional set of assumptions, which help with certain aspects of the exposition, but are not strictly necessary: The data are drawn from a random sample of size \\(n\\): observation \\((x_i,y_i)\\) comes from the exact same distribution, and is independent of observation \\((x_j,y_j)\\), for all \\(i\\neq j\\). The variance of the error term \\(\\varepsilon\\) is the same for each value of \\(x\\): \\(Var(\\varepsilon|x) = \\sigma^2\\). This property is called homoskedasticity. The error is normally distributed, i.e. \\(\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)\\) Invoking assumption 5. in particular defines what is commonly called the normal linear regression model. 6.6.1 \\(b\\) is not \\(\\beta\\)! Let’s talk about the small but important modifications we applied to model (3.3) to end up at (6.1) above: \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) and intercept and slope parameters \\(\\varepsilon\\) is the error term. First, we assumed that (6.1) is the correct represenation of the DGP. With that assumption in place, the values \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are the true parameter values which generated the data. Notice that \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are potentially different from \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) in (3.3) for a given sample of data - they could in practice be very close to each other, but \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) are estimates of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). And, crucially, those estimates are generated from a sample of data. Now, the fact that our data \\(\\{y_i,x_i\\}_{i=1}^N\\) are a sample from a larger population, means that there will be sampling variation in our estimates - exactly like in the case of the sample mean estimating the population average as mentioned above. One particular sample of data will generate one particular set of estimates \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), whereas another sample of data will generate estimates which will in general be different - by how much those estimates differ across samples is the question in this chapter. In general, the more observations we have the greater the precision of our estimates, hence, the closer the estimates from different samples will lie together. 6.6.2 Violating the Assumptions of the CRM It’s interesting to consider in which circumstances we might violate those assumptions. Let’s give an example for each of them: No Perfect Collinearity. We have seen that a perfect collinearity makes it impossible to compute to OLS coefficients. Remember the example about adding wtplus = wt + 1 to the mtcars dataset? Here it is: library(dplyr) mtcars %&gt;% mutate(wtplus = wt + 1) %&gt;% lm(mpg ~ wt + wtplus, data = .) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + wtplus, data = .) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; (Intercept) wt wtplus #OUT&gt; 37.285 -5.344 NA That the coefficient on wtplus is NA is the result of the direct linear dependence. (Notice that creating wtplus2 = (wt + 1)^2) would work, since that is not linear!) Conditional Mean of errors is zero, \\(E[\\varepsilon|x] = 0\\). Going back to our running example in figure 6.1 about wages and education: Suppose that each individual \\(i\\) in our data something like innate ability, something we might wish to measure with an IQ-test, however imperfecty. Let’s call it \\(a_i\\). It seems reasonable to think that high \\(a_i\\) will go together with high wages. At the same time, people with high \\(a_i\\) will find studying for exams and school work much less burdensome than others, hence they might select into obtaining more years of schooling. The problem? Well, there is no \\(a_i\\) in our regression equation - most of time we don’t have a good measure of it to start with. So it’s an unobserved variable, and as such, it is part of the error term \\(\\varepsilon\\) in our model. We will attribute to educ part of the effect on wages that is actually caused by ability \\(a_i\\)! Sometimes we may be able to reason about whether our estimate on educ is too high or too low, but we will never know it’s true value. We don’t get the ceteris paribus effect (the true partial derivative of educ on lwage). Technically, the assumption \\(E[\\varepsilon|x] = 0\\) implies that \\(Cov(\\varepsilon,x) = 0\\), so that’s the part that is violated. Data from Random Sample. One common concern here is that the observations in the data could have been selected in a particular fashion, which would make it less representative of the underlying population. Suppose we had ended up with individuals only from the richest neighborhood of town; Our interpretation the impact of education on wages might not be valid for other areas. Homoskedasticity. For correct inference (below!), we want to know whether the variance of \\(\\varepsilon\\) varies with our explanatory variable \\(x\\), or not. Here is a typical example where it does: As income increases, not all people increase their food consumption in an equal way. So \\(Var(\\varepsilon|x)\\) will vary with the value of \\(x\\), hence it won’t be equal to the constant \\(\\sigma^2\\). If the distribution of \\(\\varepsilon\\) is not normal, it is more cumbersome to derive theoretical results about inference. 6.7 Standard Errors in Theory The standard deviation of the OLS parameters is generally called standard error. As such, it is just the square root of the parameter’s variance. Under assumptions 1. through 4. above we can define the formula for the variance of our slope coefficient in the context of our single regressor model (6.1) as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} Var(b_1|x_i) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_i^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\tag{6.2} \\end{equation}\\] In pratice, we don’t know the theoretical variance of \\(\\varepsilon\\), i.e. \\(\\sigma^2\\), but we form an estimate about it from our sample of data. A widely used estimate uses the already encountered SSR (sum of squared residuals), and is denoted \\(s^2\\): \\[ s^2 = \\frac{SSR}{n-p} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - b_0 - b_1 x_i)^2}{n-p} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2}{n-p} \\] where \\(n-p\\) are the degrees of freedom available in this estimation. \\(p\\) is the number of parameters we wish to estimate (here: 1). So, the variance formula would become \\[\\begin{equation} Var(b_1|x_i) = \\frac{SSR}{(n-p)\\sum_i^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\tag{6.3} \\end{equation}\\] We most of the time work directly with the standard error of a coefficient, hence we define \\[\\begin{equation} SE(b_1) = \\sqrt{Var(b_1|x_i)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{SSR}{(n-p)\\sum_i^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}} \\tag{6.4} \\end{equation}\\] You can clearly see that, as \\(n\\) increases, the denominator increases, and therefore variance and standard error of the estimate will decrease. This part is largely based on moderndive, to which I am giving full credit hereby. Thanks for this great idea.↩ Regardless of the worried onlookers, I did what I had to do and I carried on to count the green pile. I know exactly how many greens are in there now! I then computed the weight of 20 Fusilli (5g), and backed out the number of Fusilli in the other piles. I will declare those numbers as the true numbers. (Sceptics are free to recount.)↩ "],

Remember that in the first set of slides we introduced Econometrics as the economist’s toolkit to answer questions like does \\(x\\) cause \\(y\\)? Let’s illustrate the issues at stake a question from epidemiologie and public health instead: Does smoking cause lung cancer? Just in case you were wondering: Yes it does! However, for a very long time the causal impact of smoking on lung cancer was hotly debated, and it’s instructive for us to look at this history. This chapter is drawn from chapter 5 of The Book of Why by Judea Pearl. Let’s go back to the 1950’s. We are at the start of a big increase in deaths from lung cancer. At the same time cigarette consumption was growing very fast. With the benefit of hindsight, we can now draw this graph: Figure 7.1: Two time series showing cigarette consumption per capita and incidence of lung cancer in the USA. However, time series graphs are poor tools to make causal statements. Many other things had changed from 1900 to 1950, all of which could equally be responsible for the rise in cancer rates: Tarring of roads Inhalation of motor exhausts (leaded gasoline fumes) General greater air pollution. We call those other factors confounders. So, there were a series of sceptics around who at the time were contesting the existing evidence. That evidence consisted in general of the following: Case-Control studies: British Epidemiologists Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill started to compare people already diagnosed with cancer to those without, recording their history, and observable characteristics (like age and health behaviours). In one study, out of 649 lung cancer patients interviewed, all but 2 had been smokers! In that study, a cancer patient was 1.5 million times more likely to be have been a smoker than a non-smoker. Still, critics said, there are several sources of bias: Hospital patients could be a selected sample of the general (smoking) population. Patients could suffer from recall bias, affecting their recollection of facts. So, while comparing cancer patients to non-patients and controlling for several important confounders (like age, income and other observable characteristics), there was still scope for bias. Moreoever, replicating those studies, as Doll and Hill attempted, would not have solved this issue. Next they attempted what doctors call a Dose-Response Effect study. In 1951 they sent out 60,000 questionnaires to British physicians asking about their smoking habits. Then they followed them over time: Only 5 years on, heavy smokers had a death rate from lung cancer that was 24 times higher than for nonsmokers. People who had smoked and then stopped reduced their risk by a factor of 2. Still, notorious sceptics like R.A. Fisher were unconvinced. The studies still failed to compare otherwise identical smokers to non-smokers. There were still important unobserved confounders out there which could invalidate the conclusion that we observed indeed a causal relationship. Let’s put a some structure on this problem now, so we can make progress. 7.1 Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAG) A DAG is a tool to visualize a causal relationship. It is a graph where nodes are connected via arrows, where an arrow can run in one direction only (hence, directed graph). Here is a simple example of a DAG, in which \\(x\\) causes \\(y\\): #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Attaching package: &#39;ggdag&#39; #OUT&gt; The following object is masked from &#39;package:ggplot2&#39;: #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; expand_scale #OUT&gt; The following object is masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; filter Figure 7.2: A simple DAG showing the causal impact of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\). Consider this setting with the following where there is a third variable, \\(z\\). It could be possible that also \\(z\\) has a direct influence on \\(y\\): Figure 7.3: A simple DAG with with 2 causal paths: Both \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) have a direct impact on \\(y\\). Now let’s change this and create a path from \\(z\\) to both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) instead. We call \\(z\\) a confounder in the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\): \\(z\\) confounds the direct causal impact of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\), by affecting them both at the same time. Figure 7.4: A simple DAG where \\(z\\) is a confounder. Pearl calls the path from \\(z\\) to \\(y\\) a backdoor path. For use the existence of \\(z\\) is particularly problematic if \\(z\\) is unobserved. 7.2 Smoking in a DAG Let’s use this and cast our problem as a DAG now. What the scientists in the 1950s faced where two competing models of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer: Figure 7.5: Two competing causal graphs for the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. In the right panel Lung Cancer is directly impacted by a genetic factor, which at the same time also influences smoking. (Arrow from smoking to cancer sometimes not visible!) Basically, what critics like Fisher were claiming was that the existing studies did not compare like for like. In other words, our ceteris paribus assumption was not satisfied. They were worried that smoking was the only relevant difference between a population of smokers and one of non-smokers. In particular, they worried that people self-selected into smoking, and that the choice to become a smoker may be influenced by other, unobserved, underlying forces - like genetic predisposition, for example. That could mean that smokers were also more likely to take risks, or more likely to be heavy drinkers, or engage in other behaviours that might be conducive to develop lung cancer. They did not formulate it in terms of genetics at the time, because they could not know until the 2000’s, when the human genome was sufficiently mapped to establish this fact (and indeed there is a smoking gene! But that’s beside the point), but they worried about this factor. The argument was settled in the eyes of most physicians, when Jerome Cornfield in 1959 wrote a rebuttal of Fisher’s points. Cornfield’s strategy was to allow Fisher to have his unobserved factor, but to show that there was an upper bound to how important it could be in determining the outcome. Here goes: Suppose there is indeed a confounding factor “smoking gene”, and that it completely determines the risk of cancer in smokers. Suppose smokers are observed to have 9 times the risk of non-smokers to develop lung cancer. The smoking gene needs to be at least 9 times more prevalent in smokers than in non-smokers to explain this difference in risk. But now consider what this implies. Let’s suppose that around 11% of all non-smokers have the smoking gene. That means that \\(9\\times 11 = 99\\%\\) of smokers need to have it! What’s even more worrying, if only even 12% of non smokers have the gene, then the argument breaks down because it would require \\(9\\times 12 = 108\\%\\) of smokers to have it, which is of course impossible. This argument was so important that it got a name: Cornfield’s inequality. It left of Fisher’s argument nothing but a pile of rubble. It’s impossible to think that genetic variation alone could be so important in determining a complex choice of becoming a smoker or not. Looking back at the right panel of figure 7.5, the link from smoking to lung cancer was much too strong to be explained by the genetic hypothesis alone. 7.3 Randomized Control Trials (RCT) Primer We now present a quick introduction to Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). The history of randomization is fascinating and goes back a long time, again involving R.A. Fisher from above.8 Suffice it to say that RCTs have become so important in Economics that the Nobel Price in Economics 2019 has been awarded to three exponents of the RCT literature, Duflo, Banerje and Kremer. RCTs are widely used in Medicine, where they originate from (in some sense). But, what are RCTs? A randomized controlled trial is a type of scientific experiment that aims to reduce certain sources of bias when testing the effectiveness of some intervention (treatment or policy); this is accomplished by randomly allocating subjects to two or more groups, treating them differently, and then comparing them with respect to a measured response. That sounds really intuitive. If we randomly allocate people to receive treatment, there can be no concern of unobserved confounders, as we have relieved the subjects of making the choice to get treated. Remember the cigarette smokers above: The concern was that an unobserved genetic predisposition correlated with both choosing to become a smoker but also with other potentially cancer-inducing behaviours like drinking or risk taking. Imagine for a moment that we could randomly select people at some young age to be selected for treatment (smoking for 30 years, say). The genetic predisposition will be equally prevalent in both treatment and control group. However, only the treatment group is allowed (and indeed forced) to smoke. Observing higher cancer rates in the treatment group would provide causal evidence for the effect of smoking on lung cancer. Thankfully, such an experiment is impossible to run on ethical grounds. We could never subject individuals to such severe and prolongued health risks for the sake of a research study. That’s why the question took to long to be settled! Let’s introduce a formal framework now to think more about RCTs. 7.4 The Potential Outcomes Model The Potential Outcomes Model, often named after one of it’s inventors the Rubin Causal Model, posits that there are two states of the world - the potential outcomes. A first state, where a certain intervention is administered to an individual, and a second state, where this is not the case. Formally, this idea is expressed with superscripts 0 and 1, like this: \\(Y_i^1\\): individual \\(i\\) has been treated \\(Y_i^0\\): individual \\(i\\) has not been treated Denoting with \\(D_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) the treatment indicator which is one if \\(i\\) is indeed treated, the observed outcome \\(Y_i\\) is then \\[\\begin{equation} Y_i = D_i Y_i^1 + (1-D_i)Y_i^0 \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] This simple equation is able to formalize a rather deep question. We only ever observe one outcome of events for a given individual \\(i\\), say \\(Y_i = Y_i^1\\) in case treatment was given. The deep question is: what would have happened to \\(i\\), had they not received treatment? You will realize that this a very natural question for us humans to put to ourselves, and to subsequently answer: How long would the trip have taken, had I chosen another metro line? What would have happened, had I chosen to study a different subject? What would have happend, had Neo taken the blue pill instead? Our ability to make those considerations distinguishes us from animals. It’s one of the biggest challenges for machines when trying to be intelligent. What makes this question so hard to answer for machines and animals alike is the fact that one has to imagine a parallel universe where the actions taken were different, without having observed that precise situation before. Neo did not take the blue pill, and whatever happened after that originated from this decision - so how are we to tell what would have happened? It’s hard, but it’s fascinating. We imagine what would have happened. Potential outcome \\(Y_i^0\\) above is what is known as the counterfactual outcome. What would have happened to subject \\(i\\), had they not received treatment \\(D\\)? Following Rubin, let us define the treatment effect for individual \\(i\\) as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\delta_i = Y_i^1 - Y_i^0 \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] Notice our insistence about talking about a single individual \\(i\\) throughout here. Keeping the potential outcome model (7.1) in mind, i.e. the fact that we only observe one of both outcomes, we face fundamental identification problem of program evaluation: Given we only observe one potential outcome, we cannot compute the treatment effect \\(\\delta_i\\) for any individual \\(i\\). Next, let’s define three average effects of interest: the Average Treatment Effect (ATE): \\(\\delta^{ATE} = E[\\delta_i] = E[Y_i^1] - E[Y_i^0]\\) the Average Treatment on the Treated (ATT): \\(\\delta^{ATT} = E[\\delta_i|D_i = 1] = E[Y_i^1|D_i = 1] - E[Y_i^0|D_i = 1]\\) the Average Treatment on the Untreated (ATU): \\(\\delta^{ATU} = E[\\delta_i|D_i = 0] = E[Y_i^1|D_i = 0] - E[Y_i^0|D_i = 0]\\) Notice that none of those can be computed from data either, because all of them require data on individual \\(i\\) from both scenarios. Let’s focus on the ATE for now. Fundamentally we face a missing data problem: either \\(Y_i^1\\) or \\(Y_i^0\\) are missing from our dataset. Nevertheless, let’s setup the following naive simple difference in means estimator \\(\\hat{\\delta}\\): \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{\\delta} =&amp; E[Y_i^1|D_i = 1] - E[Y_i^0|D_i = 0]\\\\ \\hat{\\delta} =&amp; \\frac{1}{N_T} \\sum_{i \\in T}^{N_T} T_i - \\frac{1}{N_C} \\sum_{j \\in T}^{N_C} Y_j \\tag{7.3} \\end{align}\\] in other words, we just difference the mean outcomes in both treatment (T) and control (C) groups. Now let’s consider what randomly choosing people for treatment does. The key consideration here is that the true \\(\\delta_i\\) is potentially different for each person. That is, some people will have a high effect of treatment, while others may have a small (or even negative!) effect. To learn about the true \\(\\delta^{ATE}\\), it matters who ends up being treated! Now imagine that individuals have at least some partial knowledge about their likely gains from treatment, i.e. their personal \\(\\delta_i\\). If those who expect to benefit a lot will select disproportionately into treatment, then our estimator \\(\\hat{\\delta}\\) will be biased upwards for the true average effect \\(\\delta^{ATE}\\). This is so because the average of observed outcomes in the treatment group, i.e. \\[ \\frac{1}{N_T} \\sum_{i \\in T}^{N_T} Y_i \\] will be too high. It represents the disproportionately high treatment outcome \\(Y_i^1\\) for all those who anticipated such a high outcome from treatment, and who therefore were particularly eager to get selected into treatment. Here is where randomization comes into play. Suppose we now flip a coin for each person to determine whether they obtain treatment or not. This takes away from them the possibility to select on expected gains into treatment. Crucially, the distribution of effects \\(\\delta_i\\) is still the same in the study population, i.e. there are still people with high and people with low effects. But we have solved the missing data problem mentioned above, because whether \\(Y_i^1\\) or rather \\(Y_i^0\\) is observed for each \\(i\\) is now random, and no longer a function of any other factor that \\(i\\) could act upon! Hooray! Notice how this links back to our initial discussion about DAGs above. Randomisation essentially cancels the links starting at confounder \\(z\\) in 7.4. 7.5 Omitted Variable Bias and DAGs We want to revisit the underlying assumptions of the classical model outlined in 6.6 in the previous chapter, which is closely related to the previous discussion. Let’s talk a bit more about assumption number 2 of the definition in 6.6. It said this: The mean of the residuals conditional on \\(x\\) should be zero, \\(E[\\varepsilon|x] = 0\\). This means that \\(Cov(\\varepsilon,x) = 0\\), i.e. that the errors and our explanatory variable(s) should be uncorrelated. We want \\(x\\) to be strictly exogenous to the model. Let us start again with \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{7.4} \\end{equation}\\] and imagine it represents the data generating process (DGP) of the impact of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\). Writing down this equation tightly linked to drawing this DAG from above: Figure 7.6: The same simple DAG showing the causal impact of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\). The role of \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) in equation (7.4) is to allow for random variability in the data not captured by our model, almost as an acknowledgement that we would never be able to fully explain \\(y_i\\) with our necessarily simple model. However, assumption \\(E[\\varepsilon|x] = 0\\) (or \\(Cov(\\varepsilon,x) = 0\\)) makes sure that those other factors are in no systematic relationship with our regressor \\(x\\). Why? Well if it were the case that another factor \\(z\\) is related to \\(x\\), we could never make our ceteris paribus statements of holding all other factors fixed, the impact of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\) is \\(\\beta\\). In other words, we’d have a confounder in our regression. Figure 7.7: The same simple DAG where \\(z\\) is a confounder. Notice, again, that the key here is that \\(z\\) is unobservable, hence will form part of the error term \\(\\varepsilon\\). 7.5.1 House Prices and Bathrooms Let’s imagine that equation (7.4) the impact of number of bathrooms (\\(x\\)) on the sales price of houses (\\(y\\)). We run OLS as \\[ y_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i + e_i \\] and find a positive impact of bathrooms on houses: data(Housing, package=&quot;Ecdat&quot;) hlm = lm(price ~ bathrms, data = Housing) summary(hlm) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = price ~ bathrms, data = Housing) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -77225 -15271 -2510 11704 102729 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) #OUT&gt; (Intercept) 32794 2694 12.17 &lt;2e-16 *** #OUT&gt; bathrms 27477 1952 14.08 &lt;2e-16 *** #OUT&gt; --- #OUT&gt; Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residual standard error: 22880 on 544 degrees of freedom #OUT&gt; Multiple R-squared: 0.267, Adjusted R-squared: 0.2657 #OUT&gt; F-statistic: 198.2 on 1 and 544 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16 In fact, from this you conclude that each additional bathroom increases the sales price of a house by 27477 dollars. Let’s see if our assumption \\(E[\\varepsilon|x] = 0\\) is satisfied: library(dplyr) # add residuals to the data Housing$resid &lt;- resid(hlm) Housing %&gt;% group_by(bathrms) %&gt;% summarise(mean_of_resid=mean(resid)) #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 4 x 2 #OUT&gt; bathrms mean_of_resid #OUT&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 1 -118. #OUT&gt; 2 2 955. #OUT&gt; 3 3 -11195. #OUT&gt; 4 4 32298. Oh, that doesn’t look good. Even though the unconditional mean \\(E[e] = 0\\) is very close to zero (type mean(resid(hlm))!), this doesn’t seem to hold at all by categories of \\(x\\). This indicates that there is something in the error term \\(e\\) which is correlated with bathrms. Going back to our discussion about ceteris paribus in section 4.1, we stated that the interpretation of our OLS slope estimate is that Keeping everything else fixed at the current value, what is the impact of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\)? Everything also includes things in \\(\\varepsilon\\) (and, hence, \\(e\\))! It looks like our DGP in (7.4) is the wrong model. Suppose instead, that in reality sales prices are generated like this: \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\beta_2 z_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{7.5} \\end{equation}\\] This would now mean that by running our regression, informed by the wrong DGP, what we estimate is in fact this: \\[ y_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i + (b_2 z_i + e_i) = b_0 + b_1 x_i + u_i. \\] This is to say that by omitting variable \\(z\\), we relegate it to a new error term, here called \\(u_i = b_2 z_i + e_i\\). Our assumption above states that all regressors need to be uncorrelated with the error term - so, if \\(Corr(x,z)\\neq 0\\), we have a problem. Let’s take this idea to our running example. 7.5.2 Including an Omitted Variable What we are discussing here is called Omitted Variable Bias. There is a variable which we omitted from our regression, i.e. we forgot to include it. It is often difficult to find out what that variable could be, and you can go a long way by just reasoning about the data-generating process. In other words, do you think it’s reasonable that price be determined by the number of bathrooms only? Or could there be another variable, omitted from our model, that is important to explain prices, and at the same time correlated with bathrms? Let’s try with lotsize, i.e. the size of the area on which the house stands. Intuitively, larger lots should command a higher price; At the same time, however, larger lots imply more space, hence, you can also have more bathrooms! Let’s check this out: #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = price ~ bathrms + lotsize, data = Housing) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -60752 -12532 -1674 10514 92931 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) #OUT&gt; (Intercept) 1.008e+04 2.810e+03 3.588 0.000364 *** #OUT&gt; bathrms 2.281e+04 1.703e+03 13.397 &lt; 2e-16 *** #OUT&gt; lotsize 5.575e+00 3.944e-01 14.136 &lt; 2e-16 *** #OUT&gt; --- #OUT&gt; Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residual standard error: 19580 on 543 degrees of freedom #OUT&gt; Multiple R-squared: 0.4642, Adjusted R-squared: 0.4622 #OUT&gt; F-statistic: 235.2 on 2 and 543 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16 Here we see that the estimate for the effect of an additional bathroom decreased from 27477 to 22811.5 by almost 5000 dollars! Well that’s the problem then. We said above that one more bathroom is worth 27477 dollars - if nothing else changes! But that doesn’t seem to hold, because we have seen that as we increase bathrms from 1 to 2, the mean of the resulting residuals changes quite a bit. So there is something in \\(\\varepsilon\\) which does change, hence, our conclusion that one more bathroom is worth 27477 dollars is in fact invalid! The way in which bathrms and lotsize are correlated is important here, so let’s investigate that: Figure 7.8: Distribution of lotsize by bathrms This shows that lotsize and the number of bathrooms is indeed positively related. Larger lot of the house, more bathrooms. This leads to a general result: Direction of Omitted Variable Bias If there is an omitted variable \\(z\\) that is positively correlated with our explanatory variable \\(x\\), then our estimate of effect of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\) will be too large (or, biased upwards). The correlation between \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) means that we attribute part of the impact of \\(z\\) on \\(y\\) mistakenly to \\(x\\)! And, of course, vice versa for negatively correlated omitted variables. 7.6 STAR Experiment tbd I refer the interested student to the introduction of the potential outcomes model of Scott Cunningham’s mixtape, which heavily influences this section.↩ "],
