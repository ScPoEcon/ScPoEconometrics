On this page we outline the course and present the Syllabus. As of today, this is still work in progress! Objective This course aims to teach you the basics of data analysis needed in a Social Sciences oriented University like SciencesPo. We purposefully start at a level that assumes no prior knowledge about statistics whatsoever. Our objective is to have you understand and be able to interpret linear regression analysis. We will not rely on maths and statistics, but practical learning in order to teach the main concepts. Syllabus and Requirements You can find the topics we want to go over in the left panel of this page. The later chapters are optional and depend on the speed with which we will proceed eventually. Chapters 1-4 are the core material of the course. The only requirement is that you bring your own personal computer to each session. We will be using the free statistical computing language R very intensively. Before coming to the first session, please install R and RStudio as explained at the beginning of chapter 1. Course Structure This course is taught in several different groups across various campuses of SciencesPo. All groups will go over the same material, do the same exercises, and will have the same assessments. Groups meet once per week for 2 hours. The main purpose of the weekly meetings is to clarify any questions, and to work together through tutorials. The little theory we need will be covered in this book, and you are expected to read through this in your own time before coming to class. This Book and Other Material What you are looking at is an online textbook. You can therefore look at it in your browser (as you are doing just now), on your mobile phone or tablet, but you can also download it as a pdf file or as an epub file for your ebook-reader. We don’t have any ambition to actually produce and publish a book for now, so you should just see this as a way to disseminate our lecture notes to you. The second part of course material next to the book is an extensive suite of tutorials and interactive demonstrations, which are all contained in the R package that builds this book (and which you installed by issuing the above commands). Open Source The book and all other content for this course are hosted under an open source license on github. You can contribute to the book by just clicking on the appropriate edit symbol in the top bar of this page. Other teachers who want to use our material can freely do so, observing the terms of the license on the github repository. Assessments We will assess participation in class and conduct a final exam. Team tbc Communication We will communicate exclusively on our slack app. You will get an invitation email to join in due course. "],

To get started, you will need to install two pieces of software: R, the actual programming language. Chose your operating system, and select the most recent version, 3.5.0. RStudio, an excellent IDE for working with R. Note, you must have R installed to use RStudio. RStudio is simply an interface used to interact with R. The popularity of R is on the rise, and everyday it becomes a better tool for statistical analysis. It even generated this book! There are many good resources for learning R. The following few chapters will serve as a whirlwind introduction to R. They are by no means meant to be a complete reference for the R language, but simply an introduction to the basics that we will need along the way. Several of the more important topics will be re-stressed as they are actually needed for analyses. This introductory R chapter may feel like an overwhelming amount of information. You are not expected to pick up everything the first time through. You should try all of the code from this chapter, then return to it a number of times as you return to the concepts when performing analyses. We present the bare basics in this chapter, some more details are in chapter 13. 1.2 Starting R and RStudio A key difference for you to understand is the one between R, the actual programming language, and RStudio, a popular interface to R which allows you to efficiently. The best way to appreciate the value of RStudio is to start using R without RStudio. To do this, double-click on the R GUI that you should have downloaded on your computer following the steps above (on windows), or start R in your terminal (on Linux or Mac) by just typing R in a terminal, see figure 1.1. You’ve just opened the R console which allows you to start typing code right after the &gt; sign, called prompt. Try typing 2 + 2 or print(&quot;Your Name&quot;) and hit the return key. And voilà, your first R commands! Figure 1.1: R GUI symbol and R in a MacOS Terminal Figure 1.1: R GUI symbol and R in a MacOS Terminal Typing each command after the other is however not very convenient, and we would like to be able to write all the lines of code beforehand and then run all of them in one go. We can do this by writing scripts, and RStudio makes this process very easy. Open RStudio by clicking on the RStudio application on your computer, and notice how different the whole environment is from the basic R console – in fact, that very same R console is running in your bottom left panel. The upper-left panel is a space for you to write scripts – that is to say many lines of codes which you can run when you choose to. To run a line of code, simply highlight it and hit Command + Return. We highly recommend that you use RStudio for everything related to this course (in particular, to launch our apps and tutorials). RStudio has a large number of useful keyboard shortcuts. A list of these can be found using a keyboard shortcut – the keyboard shortcut to rule them all: On Windows: Alt + Shift + K On Mac: Option + Shift + K The RStudio team has developed a number of “cheatsheets” for working with both R and RStudio. This particular cheatseet for Base R will summarize many of the concepts in this document. When programming, it is often a good practice to follow a style guide. (Where do spaces go? Tabs or spaces? Underscores or CamelCase when naming variables?) No style guide is “correct” but it helps to be aware of what others do. The more import thing is to be consistent within your own code. Hadley Wickham Style Guide from Advanced R Google Style Guide For this course, our main deviation from these two guides is the use of = in place of &lt;-. For all practical purposes, you should think = whenever you see &lt;-. 1.2.1 Glossary R: a statistical programming language RStudio: an integrated development environment (IDE) to work with R command: user input (text or numbers) that R understands script: a list of commands, each separated by a new line 1.3 Basic Calculations To get started, we’ll use R like a simple calculator. Run the following code either directly from your RStudio console, or in RStudio by writting them in a script and running them using Command + Return. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division Math R code Result \\(3 + 2\\) 3 + 2 5 \\(3 - 2\\) 3 - 2 1 \\(3 \\cdot2\\) 3 * 2 6 \\(3 / 2\\) 3 / 2 1.5 Exponents Math R code Result \\(3^2\\) 3 ^ 2 9 \\(2^{(-3)}\\) 2 ^ (-3) 0.125 \\(100^{1/2}\\) 100 ^ (1 / 2) 10 \\(\\sqrt{100}\\) sqrt(100) 10 Mathematical Constants Math R code Result \\(\\pi\\) pi 3.1415927 \\(e\\) exp(1) 2.7182818 Logarithms Note that we will use \\(\\ln\\) and \\(\\log\\) interchangeably to mean the natural logarithm. There is no ln() in R, instead it uses log() to mean the natural logarithm. Math R code Result \\(\\log(e)\\) log(exp(1)) 1 \\(\\log_{10}(1000)\\) log10(1000) 3 \\(\\log_{2}(8)\\) log2(8) 3 \\(\\log_{4}(16)\\) log(16, base = 4) 2 Trigonometry Math R code Result \\(\\sin(\\pi / 2)\\) sin(pi / 2) 1 \\(\\cos(0)\\) cos(0) 1 1.4 Getting Help In using R as a calculator, we have seen a number of functions: sqrt(), exp(), log() and sin(). To get documentation about a function in R, simply put a question mark in front of the function name, or call the function help(function) and RStudio will display the documentation, for example: ?log ?sin ?paste ?lm help(lm) # help() is equivalent help(ggplot,package=&quot;ggplot2&quot;) # show help from a certain package Frequently one of the most difficult things to do when learning R is asking for help. First, you need to decide to ask for help, then you need to know how to ask for help. Your very first line of defense should be to Google your error message or a short description of your issue. (The ability to solve problems using this method is quickly becoming an extremely valuable skill.) If that fails, and it eventually will, you should ask for help. There are a number of things you should include when contacting an instructor, or posting to a help website such as Stack Overflow. Describe what you expect the code to do. State the end goal you are trying to achieve. (Sometimes what you expect the code to do, is not what you want to actually do.) Provide the full text of any errors you have received. Provide enough code to recreate the error. Often for the purpose of this course, you could simply post your entire .R script or .Rmd to slack. Sometimes it is also helpful to include a screenshot of your entire RStudio window when the error occurs. If you follow these steps, you will get your issue resolved much quicker, and possibly learn more in the process. Do not be discouraged by running into errors and difficulties when learning R. (Or any other technical skill.) It is simply part of the learning process. 1.5 Installing Packages R comes with a number of built-in functions and datasets, but one of the main strengths of R as an open-source project is its package system. Packages add additional functions and data. Frequently if you want to do something in R, and it is not available by default, there is a good chance that there is a package that will fulfill your needs. To install a package, use the install.packages() function. Think of this as buying a recipe book from the store, bringing it home, and putting it on your shelf (i.e. into your library): install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Once a package is installed, it must be loaded into your current R session before being used. Think of this as taking the book off of the shelf and opening it up to read. library(ggplot2) Once you close R, all the packages are closed and put back on the imaginary shelf. The next time you open R, you do not have to install the package again, but you do have to load any packages you intend to use by invoking library(). 1.6 Code vs Output in this Book A quick note on styling choices in this book. We had to make a decision how to visually separate R code and resulting output in this book. We decided to prefix all output lines with #OUT&gt; to make the distinction. A typical code snippet with output is thus going to look like this: 1 + 3 #OUT&gt; [1] 4 # everything after a # is a comment, i.e. R disregards it. where you see on the first line the R code, and on the second line the output. As mentioned, that line starts with #OUT&gt; to say this is an output, followed by [1] (indicating this is a vector of length one - more on this below!), followed by the actual result - 1 + 3 = 4! Notice that you can simply copy and paste all the code you see into your R console. In fact, you are strongly encouraged to actually do this and try out all the code you see in this book. Finally, please note that this way of showing output is fully our choice in this textbook, and that you should expect other output formats elsewhere. For example, in my RStudio console, the above code and output looks like this: &gt; 1 + 3 [1] 4 1.7 ScPoEconometrics Package To fully take advantage of our course, please install the associated R package directly from its online code repository. You can do this by copy and pasting the following three lines into your R console: if (!require(&quot;devtools&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) install_github(repo = &quot;ScPoEcon/ScPoEconometrics&quot;) In order to check whether everything works fine, you could load the library, and check it’s current version: library(ScPoEconometrics) packageVersion(&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;) #OUT&gt; [1] &#39;0.1.2&#39; 1.8 Data Types R has a number of basic data types. While R is not a strongly typed language (i.e. you can be agnostic about types most of the times), it is useful to know what data types are available to you: Numeric Also known as Double. The default type when dealing with numbers. Examples: 1, 1.0, 42.5 Integer Examples: 1L, 2L, 42L Complex Example: 4 + 2i Logical Two possible values: TRUE and FALSE You can also use T and F, but this is not recommended. NA is also considered logical. Character Examples: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;Statistics&quot;, &quot;1 plus 2.&quot; Categorical or factor A mixture of integer and character. A factor variable assigns a label to a numeric value. For example factor(x=c(0,1),labels=c(&quot;male&quot;,&quot;female&quot;)) assigns the string male to the numeric values 0, and the string female to the value 1. 1.9 Data Structures R also has a number of basic data structures. A data structure is either homogeneous (all elements are of the same data type) or heterogeneous (elements can be of more than one data type). Dimension Homogeneous Heterogeneous 1 Vector List 2 Matrix Data Frame 3+ Array nested Lists 1.9.1 Vectors Many operations in R make heavy use of vectors. A vector is a container for objects of identical type (see 1.8 above). Vectors in R are indexed starting at 1. That is what the [1] in the output is indicating, that the first element of the row being displayed is the first element of the vector. Larger vectors will start additional rows with something like [7] where 7 is the index of the first element of that row. Possibly the most common way to create a vector in R is using the c() function, which is short for “combine”. As the name suggests, it combines a list of elements separated by commas. (Are you busy typing all of those examples into your R console? :-) ) c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 Here R simply outputs this vector. If we would like to store this vector in a variable we can do so with the assignment operator =. In this case the variable x now holds the vector we just created, and we can access the vector by typing x. x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) x #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 As an aside, there is a long history of the assignment operator in R, partially due to the keys available on the keyboards of the creators of the S language. (Which preceded R.) For simplicity we will use =, but know that often you will see &lt;- as the assignment operator. Because vectors must contain elements that are all the same type, R will automatically coerce (i.e. convert) to a single type when attempting to create a vector that combines multiple types. c(42, &quot;Statistics&quot;, TRUE) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;42&quot; &quot;Statistics&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; c(42, TRUE) #OUT&gt; [1] 42 1 Frequently you may wish to create a vector based on a sequence of numbers. The quickest and easiest way to do this is with the : operator, which creates a sequence of integers between two specified integers. (y = 1:100) #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 #OUT&gt; [18] 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 #OUT&gt; [35] 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 #OUT&gt; [52] 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 #OUT&gt; [69] 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 #OUT&gt; [86] 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 Here we see R labeling the rows after the first since this is a large vector. Also, we see that by putting parentheses around the assignment, R both stores the vector in a variable called y and automatically outputs y to the console. Note that scalars do not exists in R. They are simply vectors of length 1. 2 #OUT&gt; [1] 2 If we want to create a sequence that isn’t limited to integers and increasing by 1 at a time, we can use the seq() function. seq(from = 1.5, to = 4.2, by = 0.1) #OUT&gt; [1] 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 #OUT&gt; [18] 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 We will discuss functions in detail later, but note here that the input labels from, to, and by are optional. seq(1.5, 4.2, 0.1) #OUT&gt; [1] 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 #OUT&gt; [18] 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 Another common operation to create a vector is rep(), which can repeat a single value a number of times. rep(&quot;A&quot;, times = 10) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; The rep() function can be used to repeat a vector some number of times. rep(x, times = 3) #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 We have now seen four different ways to create vectors: c() : seq() rep() So far we have mostly used them in isolation, but they are often used together. c(x, rep(seq(1, 9, 2), 3), c(1, 2, 3), 42, 2:4) #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 2 #OUT&gt; [24] 3 42 2 3 4 The length of a vector can be obtained with the length() function. length(x) #OUT&gt; [1] 6 length(y) #OUT&gt; [1] 100 Let’s try this out! Your turn: 1.9.1.1 Task 1 Create a vector of five ones, i.e. [1,1,1,1,1] Notice that the colon operator a:b is just short for construct a sequence from a to b. Create a vector the counts down from 10 to 0, i.e. it looks like [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]! the rep function takes additional arguments times (as above), and each, which tells you how often each element should be repeated (as opposed to the entire input vector). Use rep to create a vector that looks like this: [1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3] 1.9.1.2 Subsetting To subset a vector, i.e. to choose only some elements of it, we use square brackets, []. Here we see that x[1] returns the first element, and x[3] returns the third element: x #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 x[1] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 x[3] #OUT&gt; [1] 5 We can also exclude certain indexes, in this case the second element. x[-2] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 5 7 8 9 Lastly we see that we can subset based on a vector of indices. x[1:3] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 x[c(1,3,4)] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 5 7 All of the above are subsetting a vector using a vector of indexes. (Remember a single number is still a vector.) We could instead use a vector of logical values. z = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) z #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE x[z] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 7 8 R is able to perform many operations on vectors and scalars alike: x = 1:10 # a vector x + 1 # add a scalar #OUT&gt; [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 2 * x # multiply all elements by 2 #OUT&gt; [1] 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 ^ x # take 2 to the x as exponents #OUT&gt; [1] 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 sqrt(x) # compute the square root of all elements in x #OUT&gt; [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 #OUT&gt; [8] 2.828427 3.000000 3.162278 log(x) # take the natural log of all elements in x #OUT&gt; [1] 0.0000000 0.6931472 1.0986123 1.3862944 1.6094379 1.7917595 1.9459101 #OUT&gt; [8] 2.0794415 2.1972246 2.3025851 x + 2*x # add vector x to vector 2x #OUT&gt; [1] 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 We see that when a function like log() is called on a vector x, a vector is returned which has applied the function to each element of the vector x. 1.9.2 Logical Operators Operator Summary Example Result x &lt; y x less than y 3 &lt; 42 TRUE x &gt; y x greater than y 3 &gt; 42 FALSE x &lt;= y x less than or equal to y 3 &lt;= 42 TRUE x &gt;= y x greater than or equal to y 3 &gt;= 42 FALSE x == y xequal to y 3 == 42 FALSE x != y x not equal to y 3 != 42 TRUE !x not x !(3 &gt; 42) TRUE x | y x or y (3 &gt; 42) | TRUE TRUE x &amp; y x and y (3 &lt; 4) &amp; ( 42 &gt; 13) TRUE In R, logical operators also work on vectors: x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) x &gt; 3 #OUT&gt; [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE x &lt; 3 #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE x == 3 #OUT&gt; [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE x != 3 #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE x == 3 &amp; x != 3 #OUT&gt; [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE x == 3 | x != 3 #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE This is quite useful for subsetting. x[x &gt; 3] #OUT&gt; [1] 5 7 8 9 x[x != 3] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 5 7 8 9 sum(x &gt; 3) #OUT&gt; [1] 4 as.numeric(x &gt; 3) #OUT&gt; [1] 0 0 1 1 1 1 Here we saw that using the sum() function on a vector of logical TRUE and FALSE values that is the result of x &gt; 3 results in a numeric result: you just counted for how many elements of x, the condition &gt; 3 is TRUE. During the call to sum(), R is first automatically coercing the logical to numeric where TRUE is 1 and FALSE is 0. This coercion from logical to numeric happens for most mathematical operations. # which(condition of x) returns true/false # each index of x where condition is true which(x &gt; 3) #OUT&gt; [1] 3 4 5 6 x[which(x &gt; 3)] #OUT&gt; [1] 5 7 8 9 max(x) #OUT&gt; [1] 9 which(x == max(x)) #OUT&gt; [1] 6 which.max(x) #OUT&gt; [1] 6 1.9.2.1 Task 2 Create a vector filled with 10 numbers drawn from the uniform distribution (hint: use function runif) and store them in x. Using logical subsetting as above, get all the elements of x which are larger than 0.5, and store them in y. using the function which, store the indices of all the elements of x which are larger than 0.5 in iy. Check that y and x[iy] are identical. 1.9.3 Matrices R can also be used for matrix calculations. Matrices have rows and columns containing a single data type. In a matrix, the order of rows and columns is important. (This is not true of data frames, which we will see later.) Matrices can be created using the matrix function. x = 1:9 x #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X = matrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3) X #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 5 8 #OUT&gt; [3,] 3 6 9 Notice here that R is case sensitive (x vs X). By default the matrix function fills your data into the matrix column by column. But we can also tell R to fill rows instead: Y = matrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE) Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 2 3 #OUT&gt; [2,] 4 5 6 #OUT&gt; [3,] 7 8 9 We can also create a matrix of a specified dimension where every element is the same, in this case 0. Z = matrix(0, 2, 4) Z #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] #OUT&gt; [1,] 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 0 0 0 Like vectors, matrices can be subsetted using square brackets, []. However, since matrices are two-dimensional, we need to specify both a row and a column when subsetting. X #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 5 8 #OUT&gt; [3,] 3 6 9 X[1, 2] #OUT&gt; [1] 4 Here we accessed the element in the first row and the second column. We could also subset an entire row or column. X[1, ] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 4 7 X[, 2] #OUT&gt; [1] 4 5 6 We can also use vectors to subset more than one row or column at a time. Here we subset to the first and third column of the second row: X[2, c(1, 3)] #OUT&gt; [1] 2 8 Matrices can also be created by combining vectors as columns, using cbind, or combining vectors as rows, using rbind. x = 1:9 rev(x) #OUT&gt; [1] 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 rep(1, 9) #OUT&gt; [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 rbind(x, rev(x), rep(1, 9)) #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] #OUT&gt; x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #OUT&gt; 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 #OUT&gt; 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 cbind(col_1 = x, col_2 = rev(x), col_3 = rep(1, 9)) #OUT&gt; col_1 col_2 col_3 #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 9 1 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 8 1 #OUT&gt; [3,] 3 7 1 #OUT&gt; [4,] 4 6 1 #OUT&gt; [5,] 5 5 1 #OUT&gt; [6,] 6 4 1 #OUT&gt; [7,] 7 3 1 #OUT&gt; [8,] 8 2 1 #OUT&gt; [9,] 9 1 1 When using rbind and cbind you can specify “argument” names that will be used as column names. R can then be used to perform matrix calculations. x = 1:9 y = 9:1 X = matrix(x, 3, 3) Y = matrix(y, 3, 3) X #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 5 8 #OUT&gt; [3,] 3 6 9 Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 9 6 3 #OUT&gt; [2,] 8 5 2 #OUT&gt; [3,] 7 4 1 X + Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 10 10 10 #OUT&gt; [2,] 10 10 10 #OUT&gt; [3,] 10 10 10 X - Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] -8 -2 4 #OUT&gt; [2,] -6 0 6 #OUT&gt; [3,] -4 2 8 X * Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 9 24 21 #OUT&gt; [2,] 16 25 16 #OUT&gt; [3,] 21 24 9 X / Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 0.1111111 0.6666667 2.333333 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0.2500000 1.0000000 4.000000 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0.4285714 1.5000000 9.000000 Note that X * Y is not matrix multiplication. It is element by element multiplication. (Same for X / Y). Matrix multiplication uses %*%. Other matrix functions include t() which gives the transpose of a matrix and solve() which returns the inverse of a square matrix if it is invertible. X %*% Y #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 90 54 18 #OUT&gt; [2,] 114 69 24 #OUT&gt; [3,] 138 84 30 t(X) #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 2 3 #OUT&gt; [2,] 4 5 6 #OUT&gt; [3,] 7 8 9 1.9.4 Arrays A vector is a one-dimensional array. A matrix is a two-dimensional array. In R you can create arrays of arbitrary dimensionality N. Here is how: d = 1:16 d3 = array(data = d,dim = c(4,2,2)) d4 = array(data = d,dim = c(4,2,2,3)) # will recycle 1:16 d3 #OUT&gt; , , 1 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 5 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 6 #OUT&gt; [3,] 3 7 #OUT&gt; [4,] 4 8 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; , , 2 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] #OUT&gt; [1,] 9 13 #OUT&gt; [2,] 10 14 #OUT&gt; [3,] 11 15 #OUT&gt; [4,] 12 16 You can see that d3 are simply two (4,2) matrices laid on top of each other, as if there were two pages. Similary, d4 would have two pages, and another 3 registers in a fourth dimension. And so on. You can subset an array like you would a vector or a matrix, taking care to index each dimension: d3[ ,1,1] # all elements from col 1, page 1 #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 d3[2:3, , ] # rows 2:3 from all pages #OUT&gt; , , 1 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] #OUT&gt; [1,] 2 6 #OUT&gt; [2,] 3 7 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; , , 2 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] #OUT&gt; [1,] 10 14 #OUT&gt; [2,] 11 15 d3[2,2, ] # row 2, col 2 from both pages. #OUT&gt; [1] 6 14 1.9.4.1 Task 3 Create a vector containing 1,2,3,4,5 called v. Create a (2,5) matrix m containing the data 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. The first row should be 1,2,3,4,5. Perform matrix multiplication of m with v. Use the command %*%. What dimension does the output have? Why does v %*% m not work? 1.9.5 Lists A list is a one-dimensional heterogeneous data structure. So it is indexed like a vector with a single integer value (or with a name), but each element can contain an element of any type. Lists are similar to a python or julia Dict object. Many R structures and outputs are lists themselves. Lists are extremely useful and versatile objects, so make sure you understand their useage: # creation without fieldnames list(42, &quot;Hello&quot;, TRUE) #OUT&gt; [[1]] #OUT&gt; [1] 42 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [[2]] #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Hello&quot; #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; [[3]] #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE # creation with fieldnames ex_list = list( a = c(1, 2, 3, 4), b = TRUE, c = &quot;Hello!&quot;, d = function(arg = 42) {print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)}, e = diag(5) ) Lists can be subset using two syntaxes, the $ operator, and square brackets []. The $ operator returns a named element of a list. The [] syntax returns a list, while the [[]] returns an element of a list. ex_list[1] returns a list contain the first element. ex_list[[1]] returns the first element of the list, in this case, a vector. # subsetting ex_list$e #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 #OUT&gt; [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 #OUT&gt; [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 ex_list[1:2] #OUT&gt; $a #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; $b #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE ex_list[1] #OUT&gt; $a #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 ex_list[[1]] #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 ex_list[c(&quot;e&quot;, &quot;a&quot;)] #OUT&gt; $e #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 #OUT&gt; [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 #OUT&gt; [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; $a #OUT&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 ex_list[&quot;e&quot;] #OUT&gt; $e #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 #OUT&gt; [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 #OUT&gt; [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 ex_list[[&quot;e&quot;]] #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 #OUT&gt; [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 #OUT&gt; [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 ex_list$d #OUT&gt; function(arg = 42) {print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)} ex_list$d(arg = 1) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Hello World!&quot; 1.9.5.1 Task 4 Copy and paste the above code for ex_list into your R session. Remember that list can hold any kind of R object. Like…another list! So, create a new list new_list that has two fields: a first field called “this” with string content &quot;is awesome&quot;, and a second field called “ex_list” that contains ex_list. Accessing members is like in a plain list, just with several layers now. Get the element c from ex_list in new_list! Compose a new string out of the first element in new_list, the element under label this. Use the function paste to print R is awesome to your screen. 1.10 Data Frames We have previously seen vectors and matrices for storing data as we introduced R. We will now introduce a data frame which will be the most common way that we store and interact with data in this course. A data.frame is similar to a python pandas.dataframe or a julia DataFrame. (But the R version was the first! :-) ) example_data = data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), y = c(rep(&quot;Hello&quot;, 9), &quot;Goodbye&quot;), z = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5)) Unlike a matrix, which can be thought of as a vector rearranged into rows and columns, a data frame is not required to have the same data type for each element. A data frame is a list of vectors, and each vector has a name. So, each vector must contain the same data type, but the different vectors can store different data types. Note, however, that all vectors must have the same length (differently from a list)! A data.frame is similar to a typical Spreadsheet. There are rows, and there are columns. A row is typically thought of as an observation, and each column is a certain variable, characteristic or feature of that observation. Let’s look at the data frame we just created above: example_data #OUT&gt; x y z #OUT&gt; 1 1 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 2 3 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 3 5 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 4 7 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 5 9 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 6 1 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 7 3 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 8 5 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 9 7 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 10 9 Goodbye FALSE Unlike a list, which has more flexibility, the elements of a data frame must all be vectors. Again, we access any given column with the $ operator: example_data$x #OUT&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 all.equal(length(example_data$x), length(example_data$y), length(example_data$z)) #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE str(example_data) #OUT&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 10 obs. of 3 variables: #OUT&gt; $ x: num 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 #OUT&gt; $ y: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Goodbye&quot;,&quot;Hello&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 #OUT&gt; $ z: logi TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE ... nrow(example_data) #OUT&gt; [1] 10 ncol(example_data) #OUT&gt; [1] 3 dim(example_data) #OUT&gt; [1] 10 3 names(example_data) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; 1.10.1 Working with data.frames The data.frame() function above is one way to create a data frame. We can also import data from various file types in into R, as well as use data stored in packages. To read this data back into R, we will use the built-in function read.csv: path = system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;,&quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;example-data.csv&quot;) example_data_from_disk = read.csv(path) This particular line of code assumes that you installed the associated R package to this book, hence you have this dataset stored on your computer at system.file(package = &quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;,&quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;example-data.csv&quot;). example_data_from_disk #OUT&gt; x y z #OUT&gt; 1 1 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 2 3 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 3 5 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 4 7 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 5 9 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 6 1 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 7 3 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 8 5 Hello FALSE #OUT&gt; 9 7 Hello TRUE #OUT&gt; 10 9 Goodbye FALSE When using data, there are three things we would generally like to do: Look at the raw data. Understand the data. (Where did it come from? What are the variables? Etc.) Visualize the data. To look at data in a data.frame, we have two useful commands: head() and str(). # we are working with the built-in mtcars dataset: mtcars #OUT&gt; mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 #OUT&gt; Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 #OUT&gt; Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 #OUT&gt; Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 #OUT&gt; Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 #OUT&gt; Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 #OUT&gt; Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 #OUT&gt; Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 #OUT&gt; Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4 #OUT&gt; Merc 280C 17.8 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90 1 0 4 4 #OUT&gt; Merc 450SE 16.4 8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40 0 0 3 3 #OUT&gt; Merc 450SL 17.3 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60 0 0 3 3 #OUT&gt; Merc 450SLC 15.2 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00 0 0 3 3 #OUT&gt; Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98 0 0 3 4 #OUT&gt; Lincoln Continental 10.4 8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82 0 0 3 4 #OUT&gt; Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42 0 0 3 4 #OUT&gt; Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 #OUT&gt; Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 #OUT&gt; Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 #OUT&gt; Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 #OUT&gt; Dodge Challenger 15.5 8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87 0 0 3 2 #OUT&gt; AMC Javelin 15.2 8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30 0 0 3 2 #OUT&gt; Camaro Z28 13.3 8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41 0 0 3 4 #OUT&gt; Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05 0 0 3 2 #OUT&gt; Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 #OUT&gt; Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 #OUT&gt; Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 #OUT&gt; Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50 0 1 5 4 #OUT&gt; Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50 0 1 5 6 #OUT&gt; Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60 0 1 5 8 #OUT&gt; Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 You can see that this prints the entire data.frame to screen.

In this dataset an observation is for a particular model of a car, and the variables describe attributes of the car, for example its fuel efficiency, or its weight. To understand more about the data set, we use the ? operator to pull up the documentation for the data. ?mtcars R has a number of functions for quickly working with and extracting basic information from data frames. To quickly obtain a vector of the variable names, we use the names() function. names(mtcars) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;mpg&quot; &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; &quot;hp&quot; &quot;drat&quot; &quot;wt&quot; &quot;qsec&quot; &quot;vs&quot; &quot;am&quot; &quot;gear&quot; #OUT&gt; [11] &quot;carb&quot; To access one of the variables as a vector, we use the $ operator. mtcars$mpg #OUT&gt; [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 17.8 16.4 17.3 15.2 #OUT&gt; [15] 10.4 10.4 14.7 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 15.5 15.2 13.3 19.2 27.3 26.0 30.4 #OUT&gt; [29] 15.8 19.7 15.0 21.4 mtcars$wt #OUT&gt; [1] 2.620 2.875 2.320 3.215 3.440 3.460 3.570 3.190 3.150 3.440 3.440 #OUT&gt; [12] 4.070 3.730 3.780 5.250 5.424 5.345 2.200 1.615 1.835 2.465 3.520 #OUT&gt; [23] 3.435 3.840 3.845 1.935 2.140 1.513 3.170 2.770 3.570 2.780 We can use the dim(), nrow() and ncol() functions to obtain information about the dimension of the data frame. dim(mtcars) #OUT&gt; [1] 32 11 nrow(mtcars) #OUT&gt; [1] 32 ncol(mtcars) #OUT&gt; [1] 11 Here nrow() is also the number of observations, which in most cases is the sample size. Subsetting data frames can work much like subsetting matrices using square brackets, [ , ]. Here, we find vehicles with mpg over 25 miles per gallon and only display columns cyl, disp and wt. # mpg[row condition, col condition] mtcars[mtcars$mpg &gt; 20, c(&quot;cyl&quot;, &quot;disp&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;)] #OUT&gt; cyl disp wt #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 6 160.0 2.620 #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 Wag 6 160.0 2.875 #OUT&gt; Datsun 710 4 108.0 2.320 #OUT&gt; Hornet 4 Drive 6 258.0 3.215 #OUT&gt; Merc 240D 4 146.7 3.190 #OUT&gt; Merc 230 4 140.8 3.150 #OUT&gt; Fiat 128 4 78.7 2.200 #OUT&gt; Honda Civic 4 75.7 1.615 #OUT&gt; Toyota Corolla 4 71.1 1.835 #OUT&gt; Toyota Corona 4 120.1 2.465 #OUT&gt; Fiat X1-9 4 79.0 1.935 #OUT&gt; Porsche 914-2 4 120.3 2.140 #OUT&gt; Lotus Europa 4 95.1 1.513 #OUT&gt; Volvo 142E 4 121.0 2.780 An alternative would be to use the subset() function, which has a much more readable syntax. subset(mtcars, subset = mpg &gt; 25, select = c(&quot;cyl&quot;, &quot;disp&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;)) 1.10.1.1 Task 5 How many observations are there in mtcars? How many variables? What is the average value of mpg? What is the average value of mpg for cars with more than 4 cylinders, i.e. with cyl&gt;4? 1.11 Programming Basics In this section we illustrate some general concepts related to programming. 1.11.1 Variables We encountered the term variable already several times, but mainly in the context of a column of a data.frame. In programming, a variable is denotes an object. Another way to say it is that a variable is a name or a label for something: x = 1 y = &quot;roses&quot; z = function(x){sqrt(x)} Here x refers to the value 1, y holds the string “roses”, and z is the name of a function that computes \\(\\sqrt{x}\\). Notice that the argument x of the function is different from the x we just defined. It is local to the function: x #OUT&gt; [1] 1 z(9) #OUT&gt; [1] 3 1.11.2 Control Flow Control Flow relates to ways in which you can adapt your code to different circumstances. Based on a condition being TRUE, your program will do one thing, as opposed to another thing. This is most widely known as an if/else statement. In R, the if/else syntax is: if (condition = TRUE) { some R code } else { some other R code } For example, x = 1 y = 3 if (x &gt; y) { # test if x &gt; y # if TRUE z = x * y print(&quot;x is larger than y&quot;) } else { # if FALSE z = x + 5 * y print(&quot;x is less than or equal to y&quot;) } #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;x is less than or equal to y&quot; z #OUT&gt; [1] 16 1.11.3 Loops Loops are a very important programming construct. As the name suggests, in a loop, the programming repeatedly loops over a set of instructions, until some condition tells it to stop. A very powerful, yet simple, construction is that the program can count how many steps it has done already - which may be important to know for many algorithms. The syntax of a for loop (there are others), is for (ix in 1:10){ # does not have to be 1:10! # loop body: gets executed each time # the value of ix changes with each iteration } For example, consider this simple for loop, which will simply print the value of the iterator (called i in this case) to screen: for (i in 1:5){ print(i) } #OUT&gt; [1] 1 #OUT&gt; [1] 2 #OUT&gt; [1] 3 #OUT&gt; [1] 4 #OUT&gt; [1] 5 Notice that instead of 1:5, we could have any kind of iterable collection: for (i in c(&quot;mangos&quot;,&quot;bananas&quot;,&quot;apples&quot;)){ print(paste(&quot;I love&quot;,i)) # the paste function pastes together strings } #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;I love mangos&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;I love bananas&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;I love apples&quot; We often also see nested loops, which are just what its name suggests: for (i in 2:3){ # first nest: for each i for (j in c(&quot;mangos&quot;,&quot;bananas&quot;,&quot;apples&quot;)){ # second nest: for each j print(paste(&quot;Can I get&quot;,i,j,&quot;please?&quot;)) } } #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 2 mangos please?&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 2 bananas please?&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 2 apples please?&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 3 mangos please?&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 3 bananas please?&quot; #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;Can I get 3 apples please?&quot; The important thing to note here is that you can do calculations with the iterators while inside a loop. 1.11.4 Functions So far we have been using functions, but haven’t actually discussed some of their details. A function is a set of instructions that R executes for us, much like those collected in a script file. The good thing is that functions are much more flexible than scripts, since they can depend on input arguments, which change the way the function behaves. Here is how to define a function: function_name &lt;- function(arg1,arg2=default_value){ # function body # you do stuff with arg1 and arg2 # you can have any number of arguments, with or without defaults # any valid `R` commands can be included here # the last line is returned } And here is a trivial example of a function definition: hello &lt;- function(your_name = &quot;Lord Vader&quot;){ paste(&quot;You R most welcome,&quot;,your_name) # we could also write: # return(paste(&quot;You R most welcome,&quot;,your_name)) } # we call the function by typing it&#39;s name with round brackets hello() #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;You R most welcome, Lord Vader&quot; You see that by not specifying the argument your_name, R reverts to the default value given. Try with your own name now! Just typing the function name returns the actual definition to us, which is handy sometimes: hello #OUT&gt; function(your_name = &quot;Lord Vader&quot;){ #OUT&gt; paste(&quot;You R most welcome,&quot;,your_name) #OUT&gt; # we could also write: #OUT&gt; # return(paste(&quot;You R most welcome,&quot;,your_name)) #OUT&gt; } It’s instructive to consider that before we defined the function hello above, R did not know what to do, had you called hello(). The function did not exist! In this sense, we taught R a new trick. This feature to create new capabilities on top of a core language is one of the most powerful characteristics of programming languages. In general, it is good practice to split your code into several smaller functions, rather than one long script file. It makes your code more readable, and it is easier to track down mistakes. 1.11.4.1 Task 6 Write a for loop that counts down from 10 to 1, printing the value of the iterator to the screen. Modify that loop to write “i iterations to go” where i is the iterator Modify that loop so that each iteration takes roughly one second. You can achieve that by adding the command Sys.sleep(1) below the line that prints “i iterations to go”. "],
["sum.html", "Chapter 2 Working With Data 2.1 Summary Statistics 2.2 Plotting 2.3 Summarizing Two Variables 2.4 The tidyverse", " Chapter 2 Working With Data In this chapter we will first learn some basic concepts that help summarizing data. Then, we will tackle a real-world task and read, clean, and summarize data from the web. 2.1 Summary Statistics R has built in functions for a large number of summary statistics. For numeric variables, we can summarize data by looking at their center and spread, for example. # for the mpg dataset, we load: library(ggplot2) Central Tendency Suppose we want to know the mean and median of all the values stored in the data.frame column mpg$cty: Measure R Result Mean mean(mpg$cty) 16.8589744 Median median(mpg$cty) 17 Spread How do the values in that column vary? How far spread out are they? Measure R Result Variance var(mpg$cty) 18.1130736 Standard Deviation sd(mpg$cty) 4.2559457 IQR IQR(mpg$cty) 5 Minimum min(mpg$cty) 9 Maximum max(mpg$cty) 35 Range range(mpg$cty) 9, 35 Categorical For categorical variables, counts and percentages can be used for summary. table(mpg$drv) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; 4 f r #OUT&gt; 103 106 25 table(mpg$drv) / nrow(mpg) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; 4 f r #OUT&gt; 0.4401709 0.4529915 0.1068376 2.2 Plotting Now that we have some data to work with, and we have learned about the data at the most basic level, our next tasks will be to visualize it. Often, a proper visualization can illuminate features of the data that can inform further analysis. We will look at four methods of visualizing data by using the basic plot facilities built-in with R: Histograms Barplots Boxplots Scatterplots 2.2.1 Histograms When visualizing a single numerical variable, a histogram is useful. It summarizes the distribution of values in a vector. In R you create one using the hist() function: hist(mpg$cty) The histogram function has a number of parameters which can be changed to make our plot look much nicer. Use the ? operator to read the documentation for the hist() to see a full list of these parameters. hist(mpg$cty, xlab = &quot;Miles Per Gallon (City)&quot;, main = &quot;Histogram of MPG (City)&quot;, # main title breaks = 12, # how many breaks? col = &quot;red&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) Importantly, you should always be sure to label your axes and give the plot a title. The argument breaks is specific to hist(). Entering an integer will give a suggestion to R for how many bars to use for the histogram. By default R will attempt to intelligently guess a good number of breaks, but as we can see here, it is sometimes useful to modify this yourself. 2.2.2 Barplots Somewhat similar to a histogram, a barplot can provide a visual summary of a categorical variable, or a numeric variable with a finite number of values, like a ranking from 1 to 10. barplot(table(mpg$drv)) barplot(table(mpg$drv), xlab = &quot;Drivetrain (f = FWD, r = RWD, 4 = 4WD)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;, main = &quot;Drivetrains&quot;, col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;, border = &quot;darkorange&quot;) 2.2.3 Boxplots To visualize the relationship between a numerical and categorical variable, once could use a boxplot. In the mpg dataset, the drv variable takes a small, finite number of values. A car can only be front wheel drive, 4 wheel drive, or rear wheel drive. unique(mpg$drv) #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;f&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;r&quot; First note that we can use a single boxplot as an alternative to a histogram for visualizing a single numerical variable. To do so in R, we use the boxplot() function. The box shows the interquartile range, the solid line in the middle is the value of the median, the wiskers show 1.5 times the interquartile range, and the dots are outliers. boxplot(mpg$hwy) However, more often we will use boxplots to compare a numerical variable for different values of a categorical variable. boxplot(hwy ~ drv, data = mpg) Here used the boxplot() command to create side-by-side boxplots. However, since we are now dealing with two variables, the syntax has changed. The R syntax hwy ~ drv, data = mpg reads “Plot the hwy variable against the drv variable using the dataset mpg.” We see the use of a ~ (which specifies a formula) and also a data = argument. This will be a syntax that is common to many functions we will use in this course. boxplot(hwy ~ drv, data = mpg, xlab = &quot;Drivetrain (f = FWD, r = RWD, 4 = 4WD)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Miles Per Gallon (Highway)&quot;, main = &quot;MPG (Highway) vs Drivetrain&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;darkorange&quot;, border = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;) Again, boxplot() has a number of additional arguments which have the ability to make our plot more visually appealing. 2.2.4 Scatterplots Lastly, to visualize the relationship between two numeric variables we will use a scatterplot. This can be done with the plot() function and the ~ syntax we just used with a boxplot. (The function plot() can also be used more generally; see the documentation for details.) plot(hwy ~ displ, data = mpg) plot(hwy ~ displ, data = mpg, xlab = &quot;Engine Displacement (in Liters)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Miles Per Gallon (Highway)&quot;, main = &quot;MPG (Highway) vs Engine Displacement&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;) 2.2.5 ggplot All of the above plots could also have been generated using the ggplot function from the already loaded ggplot2 package. Which function you use is up to you, but sometimes a plot is easier to build in base R (like in the boxplot example maybe), sometimes the other way around. ggplot(data = mpg,mapping = aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) + geom_point() ggplot is impossible to describe in brief terms, so please look at the package’s website which provides excellent guidance. We will from time to time use ggplot in this book, so you could familiarize yourself with it. Let’s quickly demonstrate how one could further customize that first plot: ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) + # ggplot() makes base plot geom_point(color=&quot;blue&quot;,size=2) + # how to show x and y? scale_y_continuous(name=&quot;Miles Per Gallon (Highway)&quot;) + # name of y axis scale_x_continuous(name=&quot;Engine Displacement (in Liters)&quot;) + # x axis theme_bw() + # change the background ggtitle(&quot;MPG (Highway) vs Engine Displacement&quot;) # add a title If you want to see ggplot in action, you could start with this and then look at that very nice tutorial? It’s fun! 2.3 Summarizing Two Variables We often are interested in how two (or more!) variables are related to each other. The core concepts here are covariance and correlation. Let’s generate some data on x and y and plot them against each other: Figure 2.1: How are \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) related? Taking as example the data in this plot, the concepts covariance and correlation relate to the following type of question: Given we observe value of something like \\(x=2\\), say, can we expect a high or a low value of y, on average? Something like \\(y=2\\) or rather something like \\(y=-2\\)? The answer to this type of question can be addressed by computing the covariance of both variables: cov(x,y) #OUT&gt; [1] 1.041195 Here, this gives a positive number, 1.04, indicating that as one variable lies above it’s average, the other one does as well. In other words, it indicates a positive relationship. What is less clear, however, how to interpret the magnitude of 1.04. Is that a strong or a weak positive association? In fact, we cannot tell. This is because the covariance is measured in the same units as the data, and those units often differ between both variables. There is a better measure available to us though, the correlation, which is obtained by standardizing each variable. By standardizing a variable \\(x\\) one means to divide \\(x\\) by its standard deviation \\(\\sigma_x\\): \\[ z = \\frac{x}{\\sigma_x} \\] The correlation coefficient between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), commonly denoted \\(r_{x,y}\\), is then defined as \\[ r_{x,y} = \\frac{cov(x,y)}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}, \\] and we get rid of the units problem. In R, you can call directly cor(x,y) #OUT&gt; [1] 0.9142495 Now this is better. Given that the correlation has to lie in \\([-1,1]\\), a value of 0.91 is indicative of a rather strong positive relationship for the data in figure 2.1 Note that \\(x,y\\) being drawn from a continuous distribution (they are joint normally distributed) had no implication for covariance and correlation: We can compute those measures also for discrete random variables (like the throws of two dice, as you will see in one of our tutorials). 2.4 The tidyverse Hadley Wickham is the author of R packages ggplot2 and also of dplyr (and also a myriad of others). With ggplot2 he introduced what is called the grammar of graphics (hence, gg) to R. Grammar in the sense that there are nouns and verbs and a syntax, i.e. rules of how nouns and verbs are to be put together to construct an understandable sentence. He has extended the grammar idea into various other packages. The tidyverse package is a collection of those packages. tidy data is data where: Each variable is a column Each observation is a row Each value is a cell Fair enough, you might say, that is a regular spreadsheet. And you are right! However, data comes to us not tidy most of the times, and we first need to clean, or tidy, it up. Once it’s in tidy format, we can use the tools in the tidyverse with great efficiency to analyse the data and stop worrying about which tool to use. 2.4.1 Reading .csv data in the tidy way We could have used the read_csv() function from the readr package to read our example dataset from the previous chapter. The readr function read_csv() has a number of advantages over the built-in read.csv. For example, it is much faster reading larger data. It also uses the tibble package to read the data as a tibble. A tibble is simply a data frame that prints with sanity. Notice in the output below that we are given additional information such as dimension and variable type. library(readr) # you need `install.packages(&quot;readr&quot;)` once! path = system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;,&quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;example-data.csv&quot;) example_data_from_disk = read_csv(path) 2.4.2 Tidy data.frames are tibbles Let’s grab some data from the ggplot2 package: data(mpg,package = &quot;ggplot2&quot;) # load dataset `mpg` from `ggplot2` package head(mpg, n = 10) #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 10 x 11 #OUT&gt; manufacturer model displ year cyl trans drv cty hwy fl cla… #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;ch&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 audi a4 1.8 1999 4 auto… f 18 29 p com… #OUT&gt; 2 audi a4 1.8 1999 4 manu… f 21 29 p com… #OUT&gt; 3 audi a4 2 2008 4 manu… f 20 31 p com… #OUT&gt; 4 audi a4 2 2008 4 auto… f 21 30 p com… #OUT&gt; 5 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 auto… f 16 26 p com… #OUT&gt; 6 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 manu… f 18 26 p com… #OUT&gt; 7 audi a4 3.1 2008 6 auto… f 18 27 p com… #OUT&gt; 8 audi a4 q… 1.8 1999 4 manu… 4 18 26 p com… #OUT&gt; 9 audi a4 q… 1.8 1999 4 auto… 4 16 25 p com… #OUT&gt; 10 audi a4 q… 2 2008 4 manu… 4 20 28 p com… The function head() will display the first n observations of the data frame, as we have seen. The head() function was more useful before tibbles. Notice that mpg is a tibble already, so the output from head() indicates there are only 10 observations. Note that this applies to head(mpg, n = 10) and not mpg itself. Also note that tibbles print a limited number of rows and columns by default.

In this dataset an observation is for a particular model-year of a car, and the variables describe attributes of the car, for example its highway fuel efficiency.

Here, we find fuel efficient vehicles earning over 35 miles per gallon and only display manufacturer, model and year. # mpg[row condition, col condition] mpg[mpg$hwy &gt; 35, c(&quot;manufacturer&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)] #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #OUT&gt; manufacturer model year #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 2 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 3 toyota corolla 2008 #OUT&gt; 4 volkswagen jetta 1999 #OUT&gt; 5 volkswagen new beetle 1999 #OUT&gt; 6 volkswagen new beetle 1999 An alternative would be to use the subset() function, which has a much more readable syntax. subset(mpg, subset = hwy &gt; 35, select = c(&quot;manufacturer&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)) Lastly, and most tidy, we could use the filter and select functions from the dplyr package which introduces the pipe operator %&gt;% from the magrittr package.1 library(dplyr) mpg %&gt;% filter(hwy &gt; 35) %&gt;% select(manufacturer, model, year) #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #OUT&gt; manufacturer model year #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 2 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 3 toyota corolla 2008 #OUT&gt; 4 volkswagen jetta 1999 #OUT&gt; 5 volkswagen new beetle 1999 #OUT&gt; 6 volkswagen new beetle 1999 Note that the above syntax is equivalent to the following pipe-free command (which is much harder to read!): library(dplyr) select(filter(mpg, hwy &gt; 35), manufacturer, model, year) #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #OUT&gt; manufacturer model year #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 2 honda civic 2008 #OUT&gt; 3 toyota corolla 2008 #OUT&gt; 4 volkswagen jetta 1999 #OUT&gt; 5 volkswagen new beetle 1999 #OUT&gt; 6 volkswagen new beetle 1999 All three approaches produce the same results. Which you use will be largely based on a given situation as well as your preference. 2.4.2.1 Task Make sure to have the mpg dataset loaded by typing data(mpg) (and library(ggplot2) if you haven’t!). Use the table function to find out how many cars were built by mercury? What is the average year the audi’s were built in this dataset? Use the function mean on the subset of column year that corresponds to audi. (Be careful: subsetting a tibble returns a tibble (and not a vector)!. so get the year column after you have subset the tibble.) Use the dplyr piping syntax from above first with group_by and then with summarise(newvar=your_expression) to find the mean year by all manufacturers (i.e. same as previous task, but for all manufacturers. don’t write a loop!). 2.4.3 Tidy Example: Importing Non-Tidy Excel Data The data we will look at is from Eurostat on demography and migration. You should download the data yourself (click on previous link, then drill down to database by themes &gt; Population and social conditions &gt; Demograph and migration &gt; Population change - Demographic balance and crude rates at national level (demo_gind)). Once downloaded, we can read the data with the function read_excel from the package readxl, again part of the tidyverse suite. It’s important to know how the data is organized in the spreadsheet. Open the file with Excel to see: There is a heading which we don’t need. There are 5 rows with info that we don’t need. There is one table per variable (total population, males, females, etc) Each table has one row for each country, and one column for each year. As such, this data is not tidy. Now we will read the first chunk of data, from the first table: total population: library(readxl) # load the library # Notice that if you installed the R package of this book, # you have the .xls data file already at # `system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;, # &quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;demo_gind.xls&quot;)` # otherwise: # * download the file to your computer # * change the argument `path` to where you downloaded it # you may want to change your working directory with `setwd(&quot;your/directory&quot;) # or in RStudio by clicking Session &gt; Set Working Directory # total population in raw format tot_pop_raw = read_excel( path = system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;, &quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;demo_gind.xls&quot;), sheet=&quot;Data&quot;, # which sheet range=&quot;A9:K68&quot;) # which excel cell range to read names(tot_pop_raw)[1] &lt;- &quot;Country&quot; # lets rename the first column tot_pop_raw #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 59 x 11 #OUT&gt; Country `2008` `2009` `2010` `2011` `2012` `2013` `2014` `2015` `2016` #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 Europe… 50029… 50209… 50317… 50296… 50404… 50516… 50701… 50854… 51027… #OUT&gt; 2 Europe… 43872… 44004… 44066… 43994… 44055… 44125… 44266… 44366… 44489… #OUT&gt; 3 Europe… 49598… 49778… 49886… 49867… 49977… 50090… 50276… 50431… 50608… #OUT&gt; 4 Euro a… 33309… 33447… 33526… 33457… 33528… 33604… 33754… 33856… 33988… #OUT&gt; 5 Euro a… 32988… 33128… 33212… 33152… 33228… 33307… 33459… 33563… 33699… #OUT&gt; 6 Belgium 10666… 10753… 10839… 11000… 11075… 11137… 11180… 11237… 11311… #OUT&gt; 7 Bulgar… 75180… 74671… 74217… 73694… 73272… 72845… 72456… 72021… 71537… #OUT&gt; 8 Czech … 10343… 10425… 10462… 10486… 10505… 10516… 10512… 10538… 10553… #OUT&gt; 9 Denmark 54757… 55114… 55347… 55606… 55805… 56026… 56272… 56597… 57072… #OUT&gt; 10 German… 82217… 82002… 81802… 80222… 80327… 80523… 80767… 81197… 82175… #OUT&gt; # ... with 49 more rows, and 1 more variable: `2017` &lt;chr&gt; This shows a tibble, which we encountered just above. The column names are Country,2008,2009,..., and the rows are numbered 1,2,3,.... Notice, in particular, that all columns seem to be of type &lt;chr&gt;, i.e. characters - a string, not a number! We’ll have to fix that, as this is clearly numeric data. 2.4.3.1 tidyr In the previous tibble, each year is a column name (like 2008) instead of all years being collected in one column year. We really would like to have several rows for each Country, one row per year. We want to gather() all years into a new column to tidy this up - and here is how: specify which columns are to be gathered: in our case, all years (note that paste(2008:2017) produces a vector like [&quot;2008&quot;, &quot;2009&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;,...]) say what those columns should be gathered into, i.e. what is the key for those values: we’ll call it year. Finally, what is the name of the new resulting column, containing the value from each cell: let’s call it counts. library(tidyr) # for the gather function tot_pop = gather(tot_pop_raw, paste(2008:2017),key=&quot;year&quot;, value = &quot;counts&quot;) tot_pop #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 590 x 3 #OUT&gt; Country year counts #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 European Union (current composition) 2008 500297033 #OUT&gt; 2 European Union (without United Kingdom) 2008 438725386 #OUT&gt; 3 European Union (before the accession of Croatia) 2008 495985066 #OUT&gt; 4 Euro area (19 countries) 2008 333096775 #OUT&gt; 5 Euro area (18 countries) 2008 329884170 #OUT&gt; 6 Belgium 2008 10666866 #OUT&gt; 7 Bulgaria 2008 7518002 #OUT&gt; 8 Czech Republic 2008 10343422 #OUT&gt; 9 Denmark 2008 5475791 #OUT&gt; 10 Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG) 2008 82217837 #OUT&gt; # ... with 580 more rows That’s better! However, counts is still chr! Let’s convert it to a number: tot_pop$counts = as.integer(tot_pop$counts) #OUT&gt; Warning: NAs introduced by coercion tot_pop #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 590 x 3 #OUT&gt; Country year counts #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 European Union (current composition) 2008 500297033 #OUT&gt; 2 European Union (without United Kingdom) 2008 438725386 #OUT&gt; 3 European Union (before the accession of Croatia) 2008 495985066 #OUT&gt; 4 Euro area (19 countries) 2008 333096775 #OUT&gt; 5 Euro area (18 countries) 2008 329884170 #OUT&gt; 6 Belgium 2008 10666866 #OUT&gt; 7 Bulgaria 2008 7518002 #OUT&gt; 8 Czech Republic 2008 10343422 #OUT&gt; 9 Denmark 2008 5475791 #OUT&gt; 10 Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG) 2008 82217837 #OUT&gt; # ... with 580 more rows Now you can see that column counts is indeed int, i.e. an integer number, and we are fine. The Warning: NAs introduced by coercion means that R converted some values to NA, because it couldn’t convert them into numeric. More below! 2.4.3.2 dplyr The transform chapter of Hadley Wickham’s book is a great place to read up more on using dplyr. With dplyr you can do the following operations on data.frames and tibbles: Choose observations based on a certain value (i.e. subset): filter() Reorder rows: arrange() Select variables by name: select() Create new variables out of existing ones: mutate() Summarise variables: summarise() All of those verbs can be used with group_by(), where we apply the respective operation on a group of the dataframe/tibble. For example, on our tot_pop tibble we will now filter mutate and plot the resulting values Let’s get a plot of the populations of France, the UK and Italy over time, in terms of millions of people. We will make use of the piping syntax of dplyr as already mentioned in section 1.10. library(dplyr) # for %&gt;%, filter, mutate, ... # 1. take the data.frame `tot_pop` tot_pop %&gt;% # 2. pipe it into the filter function # filter on Country being one of &quot;France&quot;,&quot;United Kingdom&quot; or &quot;Italy&quot; filter(Country %in% c(&quot;France&quot;,&quot;United Kingdom&quot;,&quot;Italy&quot;)) %&gt;% # 3. pipe the result into the mutate function # create a new column called millions mutate(millions = counts / 1e6) %&gt;% # 4. pipe the result into ggplot to make a plot ggplot(mapping = aes(x=year,y=millions,color=Country,group=Country)) + geom_line(size=1) Arrange a tibble What are the top/bottom 5 most populated areas? top5 = tot_pop %&gt;% arrange(desc(counts)) %&gt;% # arrange in descending order of col `counts` top_n(5) bottom5 = tot_pop %&gt;% arrange(desc(counts)) %&gt;% top_n(-5) # let&#39;s see top 5 top5 #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 3 #OUT&gt; Country year counts #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plu… 2017 5.17e8 #OUT&gt; 2 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plu… 2016 5.16e8 #OUT&gt; 3 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plu… 2015 5.14e8 #OUT&gt; 4 European Economic Area (EU27 - before the accession of … 2017 5.13e8 #OUT&gt; 5 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plu… 2014 5.12e8 # and bottom 5 bottom5 #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 3 #OUT&gt; Country year counts #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 San Marino 2015 32789 #OUT&gt; 2 San Marino 2014 32520 #OUT&gt; 3 San Marino 2008 32054 #OUT&gt; 4 San Marino 2011 31863 #OUT&gt; 5 San Marino 2009 31269 Now this is not exactly what we wanted. It’s always the same country in both top and bottom, because there are multiple years per country. Let’s compute average population over the last 5 years and rank according to that: topbottom = tot_pop %&gt;% group_by(Country) %&gt;% filter(year &gt; 2012) %&gt;% summarise(mean_count = mean(counts)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(mean_count)) top5 = topbottom %&gt;% top_n(5) bottom5 = topbottom %&gt;% top_n(-5) top5 #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 2 #OUT&gt; Country mean_count #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plus IS… 514029320 #OUT&gt; 2 European Economic Area (EU27 - before the accession of Croa… 509813491. #OUT&gt; 3 European Union (current composition) 508502858. #OUT&gt; 4 European Union (before the accession of Croatia) 504287028. #OUT&gt; 5 European Union (without United Kingdom) 443638309. bottom5 #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 2 #OUT&gt; Country mean_count #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 Luxembourg 563319. #OUT&gt; 2 Malta 440467. #OUT&gt; 3 Iceland 329501. #OUT&gt; 4 Liechtenstein 37353 #OUT&gt; 5 San Marino 33014. That’s better! Look for NAs in a tibble Sometimes data is missing, and R represents it with the special value NA (not available). It is good to know where in our dataset we are going to encounter any missing values, so the task here is: let’s produce a table that has three columns: the names of countries with missing data how many years of data are missing for each of those and the actual years that are missing missings = tot_pop %&gt;% filter(is.na(counts)) %&gt;% # is.na(x) returns TRUE if x is NA group_by(Country) %&gt;% summarise(n_missing = n(),years = paste(year,collapse = &quot;, &quot;)) knitr:::kable(missings) # knitr:::kable makes a nice table Country n_missing years Albania 2 2010, 2012 Andorra 2 2014, 2015 Armenia 1 2014 France (metropolitan) 4 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 Georgia 1 2013 Monaco 7 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 Russia 4 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 San Marino 1 2010 Males and Females Let’s look at the numbers by male and female population. They are in the same xls file, but at different cell ranges. Also, I just realised that the special character : indicates missing data. We can feed that to read_excel and that will spare us the need to convert data types afterwards. Let’s see: females_raw = read_excel( path = system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;, &quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;demo_gind.xls&quot;), sheet=&quot;Data&quot;, # which sheet range=&quot;A141:K200&quot;, # which excel cell range to read na=&quot;:&quot; ) # missing data indicator names(females_raw)[1] &lt;- &quot;Country&quot; # lets rename the first column females_raw #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 59 x 11 #OUT&gt; Country `2008` `2009` `2010` `2011` `2012` `2013` `2014` `2015` `2016` #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 Europe… 2.56e8 2.57e8 2.58e8 2.58e8 2.58e8 2.59e8 2.60e8 2.60e8 2.61e8 #OUT&gt; 2 Europe… 2.25e8 2.26e8 2.26e8 2.26e8 2.26e8 2.26e8 2.27e8 2.27e8 2.28e8 #OUT&gt; 3 Europe… 2.54e8 2.55e8 2.55e8 2.56e8 2.56e8 2.57e8 2.57e8 2.58e8 2.59e8 #OUT&gt; 4 Euro a… 1.71e8 1.71e8 1.72e8 1.72e8 1.72e8 1.72e8 1.73e8 1.73e8 1.74e8 #OUT&gt; 5 Euro a… 1.69e8 1.70e8 1.70e8 1.70e8 1.70e8 1.71e8 1.71e8 1.72e8 1.72e8 #OUT&gt; 6 Belgium 5.44e6 5.48e6 5.53e6 5.60e6 5.64e6 5.67e6 5.69e6 5.71e6 5.74e6 #OUT&gt; 7 Bulgar… 3.86e6 3.83e6 3.81e6 3.78e6 3.76e6 3.74e6 3.72e6 3.70e6 3.68e6 #OUT&gt; 8 Czech … 5.28e6 5.31e6 5.33e6 5.34e6 5.35e6 5.35e6 5.35e6 5.36e6 5.37e6 #OUT&gt; 9 Denmark 2.76e6 2.78e6 2.79e6 2.80e6 2.81e6 2.82e6 2.83e6 2.85e6 2.87e6 #OUT&gt; 10 German… 4.19e7 4.18e7 4.17e7 4.11e7 4.11e7 4.11e7 4.12e7 4.14e7 4.17e7 #OUT&gt; # ... with 49 more rows, and 1 more variable: `2017` &lt;dbl&gt; You can see that R now correctly read the numbers as such, after we told it that the : character has the special missing meaning: before, it coerced the entire 2008 column (for example) to be of type chr after it hit the first :. We had to manually convert the column back to numeric, in the process automatically coercing the :s into NA. Now we addressed that issue directly. Let’s also get the male data in the same way: males_raw = read_excel( path = system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;, &quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;demo_gind.xls&quot;), sheet=&quot;Data&quot;, # which sheet range=&quot;A75:K134&quot;, # which excel cell range to read na=&quot;:&quot; ) # missing data indicator names(males_raw)[1] &lt;- &quot;Country&quot; # lets rename the first column Next step was to tidy up this data, just as before: females = gather(females_raw, paste(2008:2017),key=&quot;year&quot;, value = &quot;counts&quot;) males = gather(males_raw, paste(2008:2017),key=&quot;year&quot;, value = &quot;counts&quot;) Let’s try to tweak our above plot to show the same data in two separate panels: one for males and one for females. This is easiest to do with ggplot if we have all the data in one single data.frame (or tibble), and marked with a group identifier. Let’s first add this to both datasets, and then let’s just combine both into one: females$sex = &quot;female&quot; males$sex = &quot;male&quot; sexes = rbind(males,females) # &quot;row bind&quot; 2 data.frames sexes #OUT&gt; # A tibble: 1,180 x 4 #OUT&gt; Country year counts sex #OUT&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #OUT&gt; 1 European Union (current composition) 2008 243990548 male #OUT&gt; 2 European Union (without United Kingdom) 2008 213826199 male #OUT&gt; 3 European Union (before the accession of Croatia) 2008 241913560 male #OUT&gt; 4 Euro area (19 countries) 2008 162516883 male #OUT&gt; 5 Euro area (18 countries) 2008 161029464 male #OUT&gt; 6 Belgium 2008 5224309 male #OUT&gt; 7 Bulgaria 2008 3660367 male #OUT&gt; 8 Czech Republic 2008 5065117 male #OUT&gt; 9 Denmark 2008 2712666 male #OUT&gt; 10 Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG) 2008 40274292 male #OUT&gt; # ... with 1,170 more rows Now that we have all the data nice and tidy in a data.frame, this is a very small change to our previous plotting code: sexes %&gt;% filter(Country %in% c(&quot;France&quot;,&quot;United Kingdom&quot;,&quot;Italy&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(millions = counts / 1e6) %&gt;% ggplot(mapping = aes(x=as.Date(year,format=&quot;%Y&quot;), # convert to `Date` y=millions,colour=Country,group=Country)) + geom_line() + scale_x_date(name = &quot;year&quot;) + # rename x axis facet_wrap(~sex) # make two panels, splitting by groups `sex` Always Compare to Germany :-) How do our three countries compare with respect to the biggest country in the EU in terms of population?

["linreg.html", "Chapter 3 Linear Regression 3.1 Data on Cars 3.2 DGP and Models 3.3 An Example: California Student Test Scores 3.4 The lm() function", " Chapter 3 Linear Regression 3.1 Data on Cars We will look at the built-in cars dataset. Let’s get a view of this by just typing View(cars) in Rstudio. You can see something like this: #OUT&gt; speed dist #OUT&gt; 1 4 2 #OUT&gt; 2 4 10 #OUT&gt; 3 7 4 #OUT&gt; 4 7 22 #OUT&gt; 5 8 16 #OUT&gt; 6 9 10 We have a data.frame with two columns: speed and dist. Type help(cars) to find out more about the dataset. There you could read that The data give the speed of cars (mph) and the distances taken to stop (ft). It’s good practice to know the extent of a dataset. You could just type dim(cars) #OUT&gt; [1] 50 2 to find out that we have 50 rows and 2 columns. A central question that we want to ask now is the following: 3.1.1 How are speed and dist related? The simplest way to start is to plot the data. Remembering that we view each row of a data.frame as an observation, we could just label one axis of a graph speed, and the other one dist, and go through our table above row by row. We just have to read off the x/y coordinates and mark them in the graph. In R: plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars, xlab = &quot;Speed (in Miles Per Hour)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Stopping Distance (in Feet)&quot;, main = &quot;Stopping Distance vs Speed&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;red&quot;) Here, each dot represents one observation. In this case, one particular measurement speed and dist for a car. Now, again: How are speed and dist related? How could one best summarize this relationship? One thing we could do, is draw a straight line through this scatterplot, like so: plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars, xlab = &quot;Speed (in Miles Per Hour)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Stopping Distance (in Feet)&quot;, main = &quot;Stopping Distance vs Speed&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;red&quot;) abline(a = 60,b = 0,lw=3) Now that doesn’t seem a particularly good way to summarize the relationship. Clearly, a better line would be not be flat, but have a slope, i.e. go upwards: That is slightly better. However, the line seems at too high a level - the point at which it crosses the y-axis is called the intercept; and it’s too high. We just learned how to represent a line, i.e. with two numbers called intercept and slope. So how to choose the best line? 3.1.2 Choosing the Best Line Suppose we have the following set of 9 observations on x and y, and we put the best straight line into it, that we can think of. It looks like this: Figure 3.1: The best line and its errors The red arrows indicate the distance of the line to each point and we call them errors or residuals, often written with the symbol \\(\\varepsilon\\). An upward pointing arrow indicates a positive value of a particular \\(\\varepsilon_i\\), and vice versa for downward pointing arrows. The name residual comes from the way we write an equation for this relationship between two particular values \\((y_i,x_i)\\) belonging to observation \\(i\\): \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{3.1} \\] Here \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept, and \\(\\beta_1\\) is the slope of our line, and \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) is the value of the arrow (i.e. a positive or negative number) indicating the distance between the actual \\(y_i\\) and what is predicted by our line. In other words, \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) is what is left to be explained on top of the line \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i\\), hence, it’s a residual to explain \\(y_i\\). Now, back to our claim that this is the best line. What exactly characterizes the best line? The best line minimizes the sum of squared residuals, i.e. it minimizes the SSR: \\[ \\varepsilon_1^2 + \\dots + \\varepsilon_N^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\varepsilon_i^2 \\equiv \\text{SSR}\\] Wait a moment, why squared residuals? This is easy to understand: suppose that instead, we wanted to just make the sum of the arrows in figure 3.1 as small as possible (that is, no squares). Choosing our line to make this number small would not give a particularly good representation of the data – given that errors of opposite sign and equal magnitude offset, we could have very long arrows (but of opposite signs), and a poor resulting line. Squaring each error avoids this (because now negative errors get positive values!) We illustrate this in figure 3.2. This is the same data as in figure 3.1, but instead of arrows of length \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) for each observation \\(i\\), now we draw a square with side \\(\\varepsilon_i\\), i.e. an area of \\(\\varepsilon_i^2\\). You will see in the practical sessions that choosing a different line to this one will increase the sum of squares. Figure 3.2: The best line and its SQUARED errors 3.1.3 Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Coefficients The method to estimate \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) we illustrated above is called Ordinary Least Squares, or OLS. There is a connection between the estimate for \\(\\beta_1\\) - denoted \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) - in equation (3.1) and the covariance of \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) - remember how we defined this in section 2.3. In the simple case shown in equation (3.1), the relationship is \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)}. \\tag{3.2} \\] i.e. the estimate of the slope coefficient is the covariance between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) divided by the variance of \\(x\\). Similarly, the estimate for the intercept is given by \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{x}. \\tag{3.3} \\] where \\(\\bar{z}\\) denotes the sample mean of variable \\(z\\). 3.1.4 Correlation, Covariance and Linearity It is important to keep in mind that Correlation and Covariance relate to a linear relationship between x and y. Given how the regression line is estimated by OLS (see just above), you can see that the regression line inherits this property from the Covariance. A famous exercise by Francis Anscombe (1973) illustrates this by constructing 4 different datasets which all have identical linear statistics: mean, variance, correlation and regression line are identical. However, the usefulness of the statistics to describe the relationship in the data is not clear. The important lesson from this example is the following: Always visually inspect your data, and don’t rely exclusively on summary statistics like mean, variance, correlation and regression line. All of those assume a linear relationship between the variables in your data. 3.1.5 Non-Linear Relationships in Data Suppose our data now looks like this: Putting our previous best line defined in equation (3.1) as \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + u\\), we get something like this: Figure 3.3: Best line with non-linear data? Somehow when looking at 3.3 one is not totally convinced that the straight line is a good summary of this relationship. For values \\(x\\in[50,120]\\) the line seems to low, then again too high, and it completely misses the right boundary. It’s easy to address this shortcoming by including higher order terms of an explanatory variable. We would modify (3.1) to read now \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\beta_2 x_i^2 + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{3.4} \\] This is a special case of multiple regression, which we will talk about in chapter 5. You can see that there are multiple slope coefficients. For now, let’s just see how this performs: Figure 3.4: Better line with non-linear data! 3.2 DGP and Models When we talk about a model in econometrics, we are making assumptions about how \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) are related in the data. For example, we have repeatedly seen the following equation, \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i \\] which is a particular kind of model. What generated our data, on the other hand, is an unknown mechanism that we want to investigate: it’s the data generating process (GDP), and our model is our assumption about how we think the GDP could look like. A natural question that comes to mind here, is how to discriminate between models, or in other words: which model to choose? 3.2.1 Assessing the Goodness of Fit In our simple setup, there exists a convenient measure for how good a particular statistical model fits the data. It is called \\(R^2\\) (R squared), also called the coefficient of determination. It is a statistic that makes use of a benchmark model, against which to compare any given model we may have in mind. Suppose we posit our standard representation of the best line: \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{3.5} \\] and let us write down the benchmark model as follows: \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{3.6} \\] As you can see, the benchmark model in (3.6) is a model with an intercept only. You will see in one of our apps that this delivers an estimate of the mean of \\(y\\). It is a benchmark because it does not include any explanatory variables, so we can compare against this other models which do in fact contain some \\(x\\)’s. Back to our \\(R^2\\) statistic: there are several equivalent definitions, and for our present case we will use the following. The coefficient of determination (R squared) is defined by \\[R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{SSR our model}}{\\text{SSR benchmark}}.\\] In the simple linear model, we have that \\(R^2 \\in [0,1]\\), where \\(R^2 = 1\\) would indicate that our model is a very good fit to the data, and vice versa for \\(R^2 = 0\\). You can interpret the value of \\(R^2\\) as the fraction of variation in outcome \\(y\\) that is accounted for by explanatory variable \\(x\\). The workings of this statistic are illustrated in the following figure 3.5. There, the left panel is our well-known depiction of the sum of squared residuals (SSR) of our model \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i\\). The right panel shows the SSR of \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i\\). Ideally, each red square would be small relative to its blue counterpart, indicating that our model has a small residual at a given observation. Figure 3.5: Left panel: SSR from our model. Right panel: SSR from benchmark (mean only) model. \\(R^2\\) compares the size of each red square to each blue square. 3.3 An Example: California Student Test Scores Luckily for us, fitting a linear model to some data does not require us to iteratively find the best intercept and slope manually, as you have experienced in our apps. As it turns out, R can do this much more precisely, and very fast! Let’s explore how to do this, using a real life dataset taken from the Ecdat package which includes many economics-related dataset. In this example, we will use the Caschooldataset which contains the average test scores of 420 elementary schools in California along with some additional information. 3.3.1 Loading and exploring Data We can explore which variables are included in the dataset using the names() function: library(&quot;Ecdat&quot;) # Attach the Ecdat library names(Caschool) # Display the variables of the Caschool dataset #OUT&gt; [1] &quot;distcod&quot; &quot;county&quot; &quot;district&quot; &quot;grspan&quot; &quot;enrltot&quot; &quot;teachers&quot; #OUT&gt; [7] &quot;calwpct&quot; &quot;mealpct&quot; &quot;computer&quot; &quot;testscr&quot; &quot;compstu&quot; &quot;expnstu&quot; #OUT&gt; [13] &quot;str&quot; &quot;avginc&quot; &quot;elpct&quot; &quot;readscr&quot; &quot;mathscr&quot; For each variable in the dataset, basic summary statistics can be obtained by calling summary() summary(Caschool[, c(&quot;testscr&quot;, &quot;str&quot;, &quot;avginc&quot;)]) #OUT&gt; testscr str avginc #OUT&gt; Min. :605.5 Min. :14.00 Min. : 5.335 #OUT&gt; 1st Qu.:640.0 1st Qu.:18.58 1st Qu.:10.639 #OUT&gt; Median :654.5 Median :19.72 Median :13.728 #OUT&gt; Mean :654.2 Mean :19.64 Mean :15.317 #OUT&gt; 3rd Qu.:666.7 3rd Qu.:20.87 3rd Qu.:17.629 #OUT&gt; Max. :706.8 Max. :25.80 Max. :55.328 3.3.2 Fitting a linear model Suppose a policymaker is interested in the following linear model: \\[testscr_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times str_i + \\epsilon_i\\] Where \\((testscr)_i\\) is the average test score for a given school \\(i\\) and \\((str)_i\\) is the Student/Teacher Ratio (i.e. the average number of students per teacher) in the same school \\(i\\). We can think of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) as the intercept and the slope of the regression line. The subscript \\(i\\) indexes all unique elementary schools (\\(i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots 420\\}\\)) and \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is the error, or residual, of the regression. (Remember that our procedure for finding the line of best fit is to minimize the sum of squared residuals (SSR)). At this point you should step back and take a second to think about what you believe the relation between a school’s test scores and student/teacher ratio will be. Do you believe that, in general, a high student/teacher ratio will be associated with higher-than-average test scores for the school? Do you think that the number of students per teacher will impact results in any way? Let’s find out! As always, we will start by plotting the data to inspect it visually (don’t worry if the syntax doesn’t make much sense right now, we will come back to it very soon): plot(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool, xlab = &quot;Student/Teacher Ratio&quot;, ylab = &quot;Average Test Score&quot;, pch = 21, col = &#39;blue&#39;) Figure 3.6: Student Teacher Ratio vs Test Scores Can you spot a trend in the data? According to you, what would the line of best fit look like? Would it be upward or downward slopping? Let’s ask R! 3.4 The lm() function We will use the built-in lm() function to estimate the coefficients \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) using the data at hand. lm stands for linear model, which is what our representation in (3.1) amounts to. This function typically only takes 2 arguments, formula and data: lm(formula, data) formula is the description of our model which we want R to estimate for us. Its syntax is very simple: Y ~ X (more generally, DependentVariable ~ Independent Variables). You can think of the tilda operator ~ as the equal sign in your model equation. An intercept is included by default and so you do not have to ask for it in formula. For example, the simple model \\(income = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot age\\) can be written as income ~ age. You can also ask R to estimate a multivariate regression such as \\(income = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot age + \\beta_2 \\cdot isWoman\\) by simply separating all variables on the right-hand side of the equation with the + operator, like this : income ~ age + isWoman. A formula can sometimes be written between quotation marks: &quot;X ~ Y&quot;. data is simply the data.frame containing the variables in the model. In the context of our example, the function call is therefore: lm(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; (Intercept) str #OUT&gt; 698.93 -2.28 As we can see, R returns its estimates for the Intercept and Slope coefficients, \\(\\hat{\\beta_0} =\\) 698.93 and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1} =\\) -2.28. The estimated relationship between a school’s Student/Teacher Ratio and its average test results is negative. Running a linear regression in R is typically a two-steps process. You first assign the output of the lm() call to an object and then call a second function (for our purpose, mainly summary()) on the resulting object. In practice, this looks like this : # assign lm() output to some object `fit_california` fit_california &lt;- lm(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool) # ask R for the regression summary summary(fit_california) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -47.727 -14.251 0.483 12.822 48.540 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

This output is called a regression table, and you will be able to decypher it by the end of this course. You should be able to find an interpret the \\(R^2\\) though: Are we explaining a lot of the variance in testscr with this simple model, or not? 3.4.1 Plotting the regression line We can also use our lm fit to draw the regression line on top of our initial scatterplot, using the following syntax: plot(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool, xlab = &quot;Student/Teacher Ratio&quot;, ylab = &quot;Average Test Score&quot;, pch = 21, col = &#39;blue&#39;)# same plot as before abline(fit_california, col = &#39;red&#39;) # add regression line Figure 3.7: Test Scores with Regression Line As you probably expected, the best line for schools’ Student/Teacher Ratio and its average test results is downward sloping. Just as a way of showcasing another way to make the above plot, here is how you could use ggplot: library(ggplot2) p &lt;- ggplot(mapping = aes(x = str, y = testscr), data = Caschool) # base plot p &lt;- p + geom_point() # add points p &lt;- p + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, size=1, color=&quot;red&quot;) # add regression line p &lt;- p + scale_y_continuous(name = &quot;Average Test Score&quot;) + scale_x_continuous(name = &quot;Student/Teacher Ratio&quot;) p + theme_bw() + ggtitle(&quot;Testscores vs Student/Teacher Ratio&quot;) The shaded area around the red line shows the width of the 95% confidence interval around our estimate of the slope coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\). We will learn more about it in the next chapter. "],
["std-errors.html", "Chapter 4 Standard Errors 4.1 What is true? 4.2 Experiencing Standard Errors 4.3 Standard Errors in Theory", " Chapter 4 Standard Errors In the previous chapter we have seen how the OLS method can produce estimates about intercept and slope coefficients from data. You have seen this method at work in R by using the lm function as well. It is now time to introduce the notion that given that \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) are estimates of some unkown population parameters, there is some degree of uncertainty about their values. An other way to say this is that we want some indication about the precision of those estimates. How confident should we be about the estimated values \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\)? Let’s remind ourselves of the example at the end of the previous chapter, and that we introduced the term confidence interval, shown here as the shaded area: The shaded area shows us the region within which the true red line will lie with 95% probability. The fact that there is unknown true line (i.e. a true slope coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\)) that we wish to uncover from a sample of data should remind you immediately of our first tutorial. There we wanted to estimate the true population mean from a sample of data, and we saw that as the sample size \\(N\\) increased, our estimate got better and better - fundamentally this is the same idea here. 4.1 What is true? We have a true data-generating process in mind. Let’s bring back our simple model (3.1) from the previous chapter: \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{4.1} \\] First, we assume that this is the correct represenation of the DGP, which looks like the above equation. With that assumption in place, the values \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are the true parameter values which generated the data. Notice, that both \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) don’t have a “hat”, which is widely used to indicate an estimate. Now, the fact that our data \\((y_i,x_i)\\) are a sample from a larger population means that there will be sampling variation in our estimates \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) - exactly like in the case of the sample mean estimating the population average as mentioned above. 4.2 Experiencing Standard Errors We would like to make this point in a purely experiential way, i.e. we want you to experience what is going on. We invite you to spend some time with the following apps, before going into the associated tutorial: library(ScPoEconometrics) launchApp(&quot;standard_errors_simple&quot;) # start with this launchApp(&quot;standard_errors_changeN&quot;) # then do that library(learnr) # load the learner library run_tutorial(&quot;standared-errors&quot;) # WIP 4.3 Standard Errors in Theory The precise formulae for the standard errors of regression coefficients depend critically on exactly which model we talk about. In other words, certain assumptions about the underlying DGP give rise to certain standard error formulas. What we continue to call the simple linear regression model is in fact a list of 5 assumptions. It is time to spell them out here: The model is linear in parameters. I.e. it looks like (4.1) above. \\((y_i,x_i)\\) constitute a random sample from the underlying population: the sample is representative. The mean of \\(\\varepsilon\\) in (4.1) is zero, conditional on \\(x\\). This means that \\(\\varepsilon\\) and \\(x\\) should not be correlated. In our simple linear regression model the standard errors of the estimates have the following form "],
["multiple-reg.html", "Chapter 5 Multiple Regression 5.1 California Test Scores 2 5.2 Interactions", " Chapter 5 Multiple Regression We can extend the discussion from chapter 3 to more than one explanatory variable. For example, suppose that instead of only \\(x\\) we now had \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) in order to explain \\(y\\). Everything we’ve learned for the single variable case applies here as well. Instead of a regression line, we now get a regression plane, i.e. an object representable in 3 dimenions: \\((x_1,x_2,y)\\). As an example, suppose we wanted to explain how many miles per gallon (mpg) a car can travel as a function of its horse power (hp) and its weight (wt). In other words we want to estimate the equation \\[ mpg_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 hp_i + \\beta_2 wt_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{5.1} \\] on our built-in dataset of cars (mtcars): subset(mtcars, select = c(mpg,hp,wt)) #OUT&gt; mpg hp wt #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 21.0 110 2.620 #OUT&gt; Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 110 2.875 #OUT&gt; Datsun 710 22.8 93 2.320 #OUT&gt; Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 110 3.215 #OUT&gt; Hornet Sportabout 18.7 175 3.440 #OUT&gt; Valiant 18.1 105 3.460 #OUT&gt; Duster 360 14.3 245 3.570 #OUT&gt; Merc 240D 24.4 62 3.190 #OUT&gt; Merc 230 22.8 95 3.150 #OUT&gt; Merc 280 19.2 123 3.440 #OUT&gt; Merc 280C 17.8 123 3.440 #OUT&gt; Merc 450SE 16.4 180 4.070 #OUT&gt; Merc 450SL 17.3 180 3.730 #OUT&gt; Merc 450SLC 15.2 180 3.780 #OUT&gt; Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 205 5.250 #OUT&gt; Lincoln Continental 10.4 215 5.424 #OUT&gt; Chrysler Imperial 14.7 230 5.345 #OUT&gt; Fiat 128 32.4 66 2.200 #OUT&gt; Honda Civic 30.4 52 1.615 #OUT&gt; Toyota Corolla 33.9 65 1.835 #OUT&gt; Toyota Corona 21.5 97 2.465 #OUT&gt; Dodge Challenger 15.5 150 3.520 #OUT&gt; AMC Javelin 15.2 150 3.435 #OUT&gt; Camaro Z28 13.3 245 3.840 #OUT&gt; Pontiac Firebird 19.2 175 3.845 #OUT&gt; Fiat X1-9 27.3 66 1.935 #OUT&gt; Porsche 914-2 26.0 91 2.140 #OUT&gt; Lotus Europa 30.4 113 1.513 #OUT&gt; Ford Pantera L 15.8 264 3.170 #OUT&gt; Ferrari Dino 19.7 175 2.770 #OUT&gt; Maserati Bora 15.0 335 3.570 #OUT&gt; Volvo 142E 21.4 109 2.780 How do you think hp and wt will influence how many miles per gallon of gasoline each of those cars can travel? In other words, what do you expect the signs of \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) to be? With two explanatory variables as here, it is still possible to visualize the regression plane, so let’s start with this as an answer. The OLS regression plane through this dataset looks like in figure 5.1: Figure 5.1: Multiple Regression - a plane in 3D. The red lines indicate the residual for each observation. This visualization shows a couple of things: the data are shown with red points, the grey plane is the one resulting from OLS estimation of equation (5.1), and the red lines show the size of the error between estimated plane and observed data. You should realize that this is exactly the same story as told in figure 3.1 - just in three dimensions! We can see from this plot that cars with more horse power and greater weight, in general travel fewer miles per gallon of combustible. Hence, we observe a plane that is downward sloping in both the weight and horse power directions. Suppose now we wanted to know impact of hp on mpg in isolation, so as if we could ask Keeping the value of \\(wt\\) fixed for a certain car, what would be the impact on \\(mpg\\) be if we were to increase only its \\(hp\\)? Put differently, keeping all else equal, what’s the impact of changing \\(hp\\) on \\(mpg\\)? We ask this kind of question all the time in econometrics. In figure 5.1 you clearly see that both explanatory variables have a negative impact on the outcome of interest: as one increases either the horse power or the weight of a car, one finds that miles per gallon decreases. What is kind of hard to read off is how negative an impact each variable has in isolation. As a matter of fact, the kind of question asked here is so common that it has got its own name: we’d say “ceteris paribus, what is the impact of hp on mpg?”. ceteris paribus is latin and means the others equal, i.e. all other variables fixed. In terms of our model in (5.1), we want to know the following quantity: \\[ \\frac{\\partial mpg_i}{\\partial hp_i} = \\beta_1 \\tag{5.2} \\] This means: keeping all other variables fixed, what is the effect of hp on mpg?. In calculus, the answer to this is provided by the partial derivative as shown in (5.2). We call the value of coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\) therefore also the partial effect of hp on mpg. In terms of our dataset, we use R to run the following multiple regression: #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -3.941 -1.600 -0.182 1.050 5.854 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

You can interpret this as follows: Holding all other variables fixed at their observed values - or ceteris paribus - a one unit increase in \\(wt\\) implies a -3.87783 units change in \\(mpg\\). Similarly, one more \\(hp\\) horse power implies a change in \\(mpg\\) of -0.03177 units, all else (i.e. \\(wt\\)) equal. 5.1 California Test Scores 2 Let us extend our example of student test scores from chapter 3 by adding families’ average income to our previous model: \\[ \\text{testscr}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{str}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{avginc}_i + \\epsilon_i \\] We can incoporate this new variable to our model by simply adding it to our formula: library(&quot;Ecdat&quot;) # reload the data fit_multivariate &lt;- lm(formula = &quot;testscr ~ str + avginc&quot;, data = Caschool) summary(fit_multivariate) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = &quot;testscr ~ str + avginc&quot;, data = Caschool) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -39.608 -9.052 0.707 9.259 31.898 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

Figure 5.2: Californa Test Scores vs student/teach ratio and avg income. While you explore this plot, ask yourself the following question: if you could only choose one of the two explanatory variables in our model (that is, either \\(str\\) or \\(avginc\\)) to predict the value of a given school’s average test score, which one would you choose? Why? Discuss this with your classmates. 5.2 Interactions Interactions allow that the ceteris paribus effect of a certain regressor, str say, depends also on the value of yet another regressor, avginc for example. To measure such an effect, we would reformulate our model like this: \\[ \\text{testscr}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{str}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{avginc}_i + \\beta_3 (\\text{str}_i \\times \\text{avginc}_i)+ \\epsilon_i \\tag{5.3} \\] The inclusion of the product of str and avginc amounts to having different slopes with respect to str for different values of avginc (and vice versa). This is easy to see if we take the partial derivative of (5.3) with respect to str: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\text{testscr}_i}{\\partial \\text{str}_i} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 \\text{avginc}_i \\tag{5.4} \\] You should go back to equation (5.2) to remind yourself of what a partial effect was, and how exactly the present (5.4) differs from what we saw there. Back in our R session, we can run the full interactions model like this: lm_inter = lm(formula = testscr ~ str + avginc + str*avginc, data = Caschool) # note that this would produce the same result: # lm(formula = testscr ~ str*avginc, data = Caschool) # R expands str*avginc for you in main effects + interactions summary(lm_inter) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = testscr ~ str + avginc + str * avginc, data = Caschool) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -41.346 -9.260 0.209 8.736 33.368 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

We observe also that the estimate of \\(\\beta_2\\) changes signs and becomes negative, while the interaction effect \\(\\beta_3\\) is positive. This means that an increase in str reduces average student scores (more students per teacher make it harder to teach effectively); that an increase in average district income in isolation actually reduces scores; and that the interaction of both increases scores (more students per teacher are actually a good thing for student performance in richer areas). Looking at our visualization may help understand this result better. Figure 5.3 shows a plane that is no longer actually a plane. It shows a curved surface. You can see that the surface became more flexible in that we could kind of bend it more. Which model do you like better to explain this data? Discuss with your neighbor and give some reasons for your choice (other than “5.3 looks nicer” ;-) ). In particular, comparing both visualizations, can you explain why we observe this strange inversion of coefficient signs?

["categorical-vars.html", "Chapter 6 Categorial Variables 6.1 Categorical Variables in R: factor 6.2 Saturated Models: Main Effects and Interactions", " Chapter 6 Categorial Variables TODO: excluded category vs intercept? Up until now, we have encountered only examples with continuous variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), that is, \\(x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), so that a typical observation could have been \\((y_i,x_i) = (1.5,5.62)\\). There are many situations where it makes sense to think about the data in terms of categories, rather than continuous numbers. For example, whether an observation \\(i\\) is male or female, whether a pixel on a screen is black or white, and whether a good was produced in France, Germany, Italy, China or Spain are all categorical classifications of data. Probably the simplest type of categorical variable is the binary, boolean, or just dummy variable. As the name suggests, it can take on only two values, 0 and 1, or TRUE and FALSE. Even though this is an extremely parsimonious way of encoding that, it is a very powerful tool that allows us to represent that a certain observation \\(i\\) is a member of a certain category \\(j\\). For example, we could have a variable called is.male that is TRUE whenever \\(i\\) is male, and FALSE otherwise. A common way to represent this is with the so-called indicator function \\(\\mathbf{1}[\\text{condition}]\\), \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{is.male}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[\\text{sex}_i==\\text{male}], \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] which would just mean \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{1}[\\text{sex}_i==\\text{male}] &amp;= \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is male} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is female}. \\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\] Notice the use of x == y to represent the relationship x is equal y, which is (very!) different from x = y meaning assign y to x. In terms of a regression formulation, this is our model when our regressor is binary: \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i,x_i\\in\\{0,1\\} \\tag{6.1} \\] Let’s run that regression here: #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = y ~ x, data = dta) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; (Intercept) x #OUT&gt; 1.889 3.756 We have seen in the app launched via launchApp(&quot;reg_dummy&quot;) that this regression simplifies to the straight line connecting the mean, or the expected value of \\(y\\) when \\(x=0\\), i.e. \\(E[y|x=0]\\), to the mean when \\(x=1\\), i.e. \\(E[y|x=1]\\). It is useful to remember that the unconditional mean of \\(y\\), i.e. \\(E[y]\\), is going to be the result of regressing \\(y\\) only on an intercept, illustrated by the red line. The red line will always lie in between both conditional means. Let’s just refresh our memory by replicating the graph from the app here in figure 6.1: Figure 6.1: regressing \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) on \\(x \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). The red line is \\(E[y]\\) Now suppose for a moment that in fact \\[ x_i = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is male} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is female}. \\\\ \\end{cases} \\] and that \\(y_i\\) is a measure of \\(i\\)’s annual labor income. The dummy variable version of the above regression is just \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\alpha \\text{is.male}_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{6.2} \\] where \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{is.male}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==1], \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] and the resulting estimates of \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) are in fact the same. Here we see the estimates from (6.2): #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = y ~ is.male, data = dta) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -1.40227 -0.50683 -0.09763 0.66287 1.53463 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

The relevant data type representing a categorical variable is called factor. We encountered them as basic data types in section 1.8 already, but it is worth repeating this here. We have seen that a factor categorizes a usually small number of numeric values by labels, as in this example which is similar to what I used to create regressor is.male for the above regression: is.male = factor(x = c(0,1,1,0), labels = c(FALSE,TRUE)) is.male #OUT&gt; [1] FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE #OUT&gt; Levels: FALSE TRUE You can see the result is a vector object of type factor with 4 entries, whereby 0 is represented as FALSE and 1 as TRUE. An other example could be if we wanted to record a variable sex instead, and we could do sex = factor(x = c(0,1,1,0), labels = c(&quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;)) sex #OUT&gt; [1] female male male female #OUT&gt; Levels: female male You can see that this is almost identical, just the labels are different. 6.1.1 More Levels We can go binary categorical variables such as TRUE vs FALSE. For example, suppose that \\(x\\) measures educational attainment, i.e. it is now something like \\(x_i \\in \\{\\text{high school,some college,BA,MSc}\\}\\). In R parlance, high school, some college, BA, MSc are the levels of factor \\(x\\). A straightforward extension of the above would dictate to create one dummy variable for each category (or level), like \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{has.HS}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{high school}] \\\\ \\text{has.someCol}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{some college}] \\\\ \\text{has.BA}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{BA}] \\\\ \\text{has.MSc}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{MSc}] \\end{align*}\\] but you can see that this is cumbersome. There is a better solution for us available: factor(x = c(1,1,2,4,3,4),labels = c(&quot;HS&quot;,&quot;someCol&quot;,&quot;BA&quot;,&quot;MSc&quot;)) #OUT&gt; [1] HS HS someCol MSc BA MSc #OUT&gt; Levels: HS someCol BA MSc Notice here that R will apply the labels in increasing order the way you supplied it (i.e. a numerical value 4 will correspond to “MSc”, no matter the ordering in x.) 6.1.2 factor and lm() The above developed factor terminology fits neatly into R’s linear model fitting framework. Let us illustrate the simplest use by way of example. library(Ecdat) # need to load this library data(&quot;Wages&quot;) # from Ecdat str(Wages) # let&#39;s examine this dataset! #OUT&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 4165 obs. of 12 variables: #OUT&gt; $ exp : int 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30 31 32 ... #OUT&gt; $ wks : int 32 43 40 39 42 35 32 34 27 33 ... #OUT&gt; $ bluecol: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 ... #OUT&gt; $ ind : int 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ... #OUT&gt; $ south : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 ... #OUT&gt; $ smsa : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... #OUT&gt; $ married: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... #OUT&gt; $ sex : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... #OUT&gt; $ union : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 ... #OUT&gt; $ ed : int 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 11 11 11 ... #OUT&gt; $ black : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... #OUT&gt; $ lwage : num 5.56 5.72 6 6 6.06 ... Assume that this is a single cross section for wages of US workers. The main outcome variable is lwage which stands for logarithm of wage. Let’s initially say that a workers wage depends only on his experience, measured in the number of years he/she worked full-time: \\[ \\ln w_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 exp_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{6.3} \\] lm_w = lm(lwage ~ exp, data = Wages) summary(lm_w) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = lwage ~ exp, data = Wages) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -2.30153 -0.29144 0.02307 0.27927 1.97171 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

Given the log transformation on wages, we can just exponentiate that to get an estimated effect on the (geometric!) mean of wages as \\(\\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = 1.0088491\\). This means that hourly wages increase by roughly \\(100 * (\\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_1)-1) = 0.88\\) percent with an additional year of experience. We can verify the positive relationship in figure 6.2. Figure 6.2: log wage vs experience. Red line shows the regression. Now let’s investigate whether this relationship different for men and women. \\[ \\ln w_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 exp_i + \\beta_2 sex_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{6.4} \\] We can do this easily by using the update function as follows: lm_sex = update(lm_w, . ~ . + sex) # update lm_w with same LHS, same RHS, but add sex to it summary(lm_sex) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = lwage ~ exp + sex, data = Wages) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -1.87081 -0.26688 0.01733 0.26336 1.90325 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

Remember from above that sex is a factor with 2 levels female and male. We see in the above output that R included a regressor called sexmale \\(=\\mathbf{1}[sex_i==&quot;male&quot;]\\). This is a combination of the variable name sex and the level which was included in the regression. In other words, R chooses a reference category (by default the first of all levels by order of appearance), which is excluded - here this is sex==&quot;female&quot;. The interpretation is that \\(\\beta_2\\) measures the effect of being male relative to being female. R automatically creates a dummy variable for each potential level, excluding the first category. In particular, if sex had a third category dont want to say, there would be an additional regressor called sexdontwanttosay. Figure 6.3: log wage vs experience with different intercepts by sex Figure 6.3 illustrates this. You can see that both male and female have the same upward sloping regression line. But you can also see that there is a parallel downward shift from male to female line. The estimate of \\(\\beta_2 = 0.45\\) is the size of the downward shift. 6.2 Saturated Models: Main Effects and Interactions You can see above that we restricted male and female to have the same slope with repect to years of experience. This may or may not be a good assumption. Thankfully, the dummy variable regression machinery allows for a quick solution to this - so-called interaction effects. As already introduced in chapter 5.2, interactions allow that the ceteris paribus effect of a certain regressor, exp say, depends also on the value of yet another regressor, sex for example. Suppose then we would like to see whether male and female not only have different intercepts, but also different slopes with respect to exp in figure 6.3. Therefore we formulate this version of our model: \\[ \\ln w_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 exp_i + \\beta_2 sex_i + \\beta_3 (sex_i \\times exp_i) + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{6.5} \\] The inclusion of the product of exp and sex amounts to having different slopes for different categories in sex. This is easy to see if we take the partial derivative of (6.5) with respect to sex: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\ln w_i}{\\partial sex_i} = \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 exp_i \\tag{6.6} \\] Back in our R session, we can run the full interactions model like this: lm_inter = lm(lwage ~ exp*sex, data = Wages) summary(lm_inter) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = lwage ~ exp * sex, data = Wages) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -1.82137 -0.26797 0.01781 0.26231 1.90757 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

It turns out that in this example, the estimate for the interaction is not statistically significant, i.e. we cannot reject the null hypothesis that \\(\\beta_3 = 0\\). (If, for some reason, you wanted to include only the interaction, you could supply directly formula = lwage ~ exp:sex to lm, although this would be a rather difficult to interpret model.) We call a model like (6.5) a saturated model, because it includes all main effects and possible interactions. What our little exercise showed us was that with the sample of data at hand, we cannot actually claim that there exists a differential slope for male and female, so the model with main effects only may be more appropriate here. To finally illustrate the limits of interpretability when including interactions, suppose we run the fully saturated model for sex, smsa, union and bluecol, including all main and all interaction effects: lm_full = lm(lwage ~ sex*smsa*union*bluecol,data=Wages) summary(lm_full) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Call: #OUT&gt; lm(formula = lwage ~ sex * smsa * union * bluecol, data = Wages) #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Residuals: #OUT&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #OUT&gt; -1.95214 -0.23409 -0.01681 0.25317 1.90450 #OUT&gt; #OUT&gt; Coefficients: #OUT&gt; Estimate Std.

One-way interactions are still ok to interpret as well: sexmale:bluecolyes indicates in addition to a wage premium over females of 0.67, and a penalty of being blue collar of -0.34, male blue collar workers suffer an additional wage loss of -0.15. All of this is relative to the base category, which are female white collar workers who don’t live in an smsa and are not union members. If we now add a third or even a fourth interaction, this becomes much harder to interpret, and in fact we rarely see such interactions in applied work. "],

To illustrate this, we will first create two vectors. a_vec = c(1, 2, 3) b_vec = c(2, 2, 2) Note that these are indeed vectors. They are not matrices. c(is.vector(a_vec), is.vector(b_vec)) #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE TRUE c(is.matrix(a_vec), is.matrix(b_vec)) #OUT&gt; [1] FALSE FALSE When this is the case, the %*% operator is used to calculate the dot product, also know as the inner product of the two vectors. The dot product of vectors \\(\\boldsymbol{a} = \\lbrack a_1, a_2, \\cdots a_n \\rbrack\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{b} = \\lbrack b_1, b_2, \\cdots b_n \\rbrack\\) is defined to be \\[ \\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_i b_i = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \\cdots a_n b_n. \\] a_vec %*% b_vec # inner product #OUT&gt; [,1] #OUT&gt; [1,] 12 a_vec %o% b_vec # outer product #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 2 2 2 #OUT&gt; [2,] 4 4 4 #OUT&gt; [3,] 6 6 6 The %o% operator is used to calculate the outer product of the two vectors. When vectors are coerced to become matrices, they are column vectors. So a vector of length \\(n\\) becomes an \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix after coercion. as.matrix(a_vec) #OUT&gt; [,1] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 #OUT&gt; [3,] 3 If we use the %*% operator on matrices, %*% again performs the expected matrix multiplication. So you might expect the following to produce an error, because the dimensions are incorrect. as.matrix(a_vec) %*% b_vec #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 2 2 2 #OUT&gt; [2,] 4 4 4 #OUT&gt; [3,] 6 6 6 At face value this is a \\(3 \\times 1\\) matrix, multiplied by a \\(3 \\times 1\\) matrix. However, when b_vec is automatically coerced to be a matrix, R decided to make it a “row vector”, a \\(1 \\times 3\\) matrix, so that the multiplication has conformable dimensions. If we had coerced both, then R would produce an error. as.matrix(a_vec) %*% as.matrix(b_vec) Another way to calculate a dot product is with the crossprod() function. Given two vectors, the crossprod() function calculates their dot product. The function has a rather misleading name. crossprod(a_vec, b_vec) # inner product #OUT&gt; [,1] #OUT&gt; [1,] 12 tcrossprod(a_vec, b_vec) # outer product #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 2 2 2 #OUT&gt; [2,] 4 4 4 #OUT&gt; [3,] 6 6 6 These functions could be very useful later. When used with matrices \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) as arguments, it calculates \\[ X^\\top Y. \\] When dealing with linear models, the calculation \\[ X^\\top X \\] is used repeatedly. C_mat = matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 2, 3) D_mat = matrix(c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2), 2, 3) This is useful both as a shortcut for a frequent calculation and as a more efficient implementation than using t() and %*%. crossprod(C_mat, D_mat) #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 6 6 6 #OUT&gt; [2,] 14 14 14 #OUT&gt; [3,] 22 22 22 t(C_mat) %*% D_mat #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 6 6 6 #OUT&gt; [2,] 14 14 14 #OUT&gt; [3,] 22 22 22 all.equal(crossprod(C_mat, D_mat), t(C_mat) %*% D_mat) #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE crossprod(C_mat, C_mat) #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 5 11 17 #OUT&gt; [2,] 11 25 39 #OUT&gt; [3,] 17 39 61 t(C_mat) %*% C_mat #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 5 11 17 #OUT&gt; [2,] 11 25 39 #OUT&gt; [3,] 17 39 61 all.equal(crossprod(C_mat, C_mat), t(C_mat) %*% C_mat) #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE 13.3 Matrices Z = matrix(c(9, 2, -3, 2, 4, -2, -3, -2, 16), 3, byrow = TRUE) Z #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 9 2 -3 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 4 -2 #OUT&gt; [3,] -3 -2 16 solve(Z) #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 0.12931034 -0.05603448 0.01724138 #OUT&gt; [2,] -0.05603448 0.29094828 0.02586207 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0.01724138 0.02586207 0.06896552 To verify that solve(Z) returns the inverse, we multiply it by Z. We would expect this to return the identity matrix, however we see that this is not the case due to some computational issues. However, R also has the all.equal() function which checks for equality, with some small tolerance which accounts for some computational issues. The identical() function is used to check for exact equality. solve(Z) %*% Z #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1.000000e+00 -6.245005e-17 0.000000e+00 #OUT&gt; [2,] 8.326673e-17 1.000000e+00 5.551115e-17 #OUT&gt; [3,] 2.775558e-17 0.000000e+00 1.000000e+00 diag(3) #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 1 0 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0 0 1 all.equal(solve(Z) %*% Z, diag(3)) #OUT&gt; [1] TRUE R has a number of matrix specific functions for obtaining dimension and summary information. X = matrix(1:6, 2, 3) X #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 3 5 #OUT&gt; [2,] 2 4 6 dim(X) #OUT&gt; [1] 2 3 rowSums(X) #OUT&gt; [1] 9 12 colSums(X) #OUT&gt; [1] 3 7 11 rowMeans(X) #OUT&gt; [1] 3 4 colMeans(X) #OUT&gt; [1] 1.5 3.5 5.5 The diag() function can be used in a number of ways. We can extract the diagonal of a matrix. diag(Z) #OUT&gt; [1] 9 4 16 Or create a matrix with specified elements on the diagonal. (And 0 on the off-diagonals.) diag(1:5) #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 2 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0 0 3 0 0 #OUT&gt; [4,] 0 0 0 4 0 #OUT&gt; [5,] 0 0 0 0 5 Or, lastly, create a square matrix of a certain dimension with 1 for every element of the diagonal and 0 for the off-diagonals. diag(5) #OUT&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] #OUT&gt; [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 #OUT&gt; [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 #OUT&gt; [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 #OUT&gt; [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 "],
