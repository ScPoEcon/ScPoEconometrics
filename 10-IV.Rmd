# Instrumental Variables (IV) {#IV}

In the previous chapters we have seen how to get credible causal estimates for the effect of some intervention via randomization techniques. Randomly allocating a subject to treatment or control groups makes sure that *everything else is equal*, hence we are really comparing apples with apples. Unfortunately, oftentimes we cannot perform a randomized control trial (RCT), out of technological, ethical, or other constraints. (We mentioned that forcing people to smoke via lottery draw is impossible to justify.)

So, that's it, no RCT, no causal estimates?

No! Methods like instrumental variables can help us to establish causality if we only have *observational data* (i.e. data generated not via experiment). That's reassuring, because in many settings this kind of data is the only thing we have.
