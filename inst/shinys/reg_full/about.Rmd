This app contains 10 interactive examples of OLS regression.

Simply slide the `example` slider to switch example.

The `noise` slider allows you to change the standard deviation of the idiosyncratic noise $\epsilon$ in the data generating process:

$$Y = \alpha + \beta X + \epsilon, \qquad \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$

Your current guess' SSR is also displayed below the figure.

### Observe

+ For each example, check that you indeed reach the minimum SSR possible.

+ What happens when you increase the noise of the data generating process? Do your best guesses for slope and intercept change? What happens to the SSR of the best fit line?
