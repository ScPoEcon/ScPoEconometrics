# Welcome to ScPoEconometrics!

- In this course you will learn about the basics of *Econometrics*.
 
--

- You will also learn to use the `R` software.

--

## What is *Econometrics*, actually?

- A set of techniques and methods to answer questions with data.

- Econometrics shares many things with Applied Statistics and Machine Learning. 

- Some Examples!

---

# Answering Questions with Econometrics


[&lt;ru-blockquote&gt;
Does inauguration of World Bank-financed projects in Sub-Saharan Africa *cause* an electoral benefit for the incumbent?
&lt;/ru-blockquote&gt;](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aSDEhq-ZGlUcX5QxWbb-0bAcAdSUXlKc/view?usp=sharing)

--

[&lt;ru-blockquote&gt;
Does a certain concentration of `airbnb` listings in some urban area *cause* an increase in long-term rents?
&lt;/ru-blockquote&gt;](https://floswald.github.io/project/airbnb/)

--

[&lt;ru-blockquote&gt;
Will increasing the minimum wage *cause* greater unemployment?
&lt;/ru-blockquote&gt;](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf)

---

# Causality

* Notice the keyword **cause** in all of the above.

* Notice also that *many other factors could have caused* each of those outcomes.

* Econometrics is often about spelling out conditions under which we can claim to measure causal relationships.

* We will encounter the most basic of those conditions, and talk about some potential pitfalls.

---

# This Course

- Teach you the basics of *Linear Regression*

--

- Introduce you to the `R` software environment.

--

- This is *not* a course about `R`.

--

## Grades

1. There will be quizzes on Moodle roughly every two weeks.

2. There will be two or three take home exams / case studies.

3. There will be _no_ final exam. Your grade will be 40% of 1 and 60% of 2.

## What is `R`?&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

To quote the [`R` project website](https://www.r-project.org):

&gt; R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

--

What does that mean?

- `R` was created for statistical and graphical work.

- `R` has a vibrant, thriving online community. ([stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r))

- Plus it's __free__ and __open source__.

## Why are we using `R`?

1\. `R` is __free__ and __open source__â€”saving both you and the university ðŸ’°ðŸ’µðŸ’°.

2\. _Related:_ Outside of a small group of economists, private- and public-sector __employers favor `R`__ over .mono[Stata] and most competing softwares.

3\. `R` is very __flexible and powerful__â€”adaptable to nearly any task, _e.g._, 'metrics, spatial data analysis, machine learning, web scraping, data cleaning, website building, teaching. 

---

## Why are we using `R`?

4\. _Related:_ `R` imposes __no limitations__ on your amount of observations, variables, memory, or processing power. (I'm looking at __you__, .mono[Stata].)

5\. If you put in the work&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, you will come away with a __valuable and marketable__ tool.

6\. I ðŸ’– __R__

.footnote[
[2]: Learning `R` definitely requires time and effort.

# Start your `Rstudio`!

## First Glossary of Terms

* `R`: a statistical programming language

* `RStudio`: an integrated development environment (IDE) to work with `R`

* *command*: user input (text or numbers) that `R` *understands*.

* *script*: a list of commands collected in a text file, each separated by a new line, to be run one after the other.

---

# R as a Calculator

* Let's do some basic arithmetic first:
    
    ```r
    4 + 1
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 5
    ```
    
    ```r
    8 / 2
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 4
    ```
--

* Great! What about this?
    
    ```r
    log(exp(1))
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 1
    ```
    
    ```r
    # by the way: this is a comment! (R disregards it)
    ```

---

# Calculator 2


---

# Calculator 2

* We can also do exponents with `^`:


```r
x = 2
x^3
```

```
## [1] 8
```

* Square roots


```r
sqrt(2)
```

```
## [1] 1.414214
```

* and many logarithmic and trigonometric functions.
* many ... What??

# Where to get Help?

* `R` built-in `help`:

```r
?log
?sin
?paste
?lm
help(lm)   # help() is equivalent
??plot  # get all help on keyword "plot"
help(ggplot,package="ggplot2")  # show help from a certain package
```

* Help from Humans!
  * [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com) [SO]
  * Your classroom channel on Slack
  * [rstudio forum](https://community.rstudio.com)
  
  
---

# HOW to get Help?

1. Describe what you want to do.

1. Describe what you *expect* your code to do.

1. Describe what you your code *does instead*.
  * Provide the entire error message.
  
1. Provide enough code to *reproduce* your error.
  * You can post post code snippets on slack and SO

---

# R Packages

* `R` users contribute add-on data and functions as *packages*
* Installing packages is easy!


```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

* To *use* the contents of a packge, we must load it from our library:


```r
library(ggplot2)
```

---

# `ScPoEconometrics` package

* We wrote an `R` package for you.
* It's hosted on github.com
* You can install (and frequently update!) from there:
    
    ```r
    if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github(repo = "ScPoEcon/ScPoEconometrics")
    ```

--

* Did it work?
    
    ```r
    library(ScPoEconometrics)
    packageVersion("ScPoEconometrics")
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] '0.2.2'
    ```

---

# Data Types and Data Structures


- Numeric: `1.0, 2.1`
- Integer: `1L`, `2L`, `42L`
- Logical: `TRUE` and `FALSE`
- Character: `"a"`, `"Statistics"`, `"1 plus 2."`
- Categorical or `factor`

* [You should read more right here!](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/R-intro.html#data-types)

---

# Vectors


* What *is* a **vector**?
* The `c` function creates vectors.

```r
c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
```

```
## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9
```

* Coercion to unique types:

```r
c(42, "Statistics", TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "42"         "Statistics" "TRUE"
```

* Creating a *Range*

```r
(y = 1:6)
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
```


---

# Vectors from Sequences and Repetitions


* `seq` creates a sequence `from` `to` in steps of `by`:
    
    ```r
    seq(from = 1.5, to = 2.1, by = 0.1)
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1
    ```
* `rep` repeats items:
    
    ```r
    rep("A", times = 10)
    ```
    
    ```
    ##  [1] "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A"
    ```
* They also work in combination:
    
    ```r
    c(x, rep(seq(1, 9, 2), 3), c(1, 2, 3), 42, 2:4)
    ```
    
    ```
    ##  [1]  2  1  3  5  7  9  1  3  5  7  9  1  3  5  7  9  1  2  3 42  2  3  4
    ```

# YOUR TURNs

---
class: inverse

# Task 1

* Create a vector of five ones, i.e.

```
## [1] 1 1 1 1 1
```
* Notice that the colon operator `a:b` is just short for *construct a sequence from `a` to `b`*. Create a vector the counts down from 10 to 0, i.e. it looks like

```
##  [1] 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
```
* Use `rep` to create a vector that looks like this:

```
##  [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
```
* Find out (using `help()`, google or whatever) how to get the *length* of a vector in `R`!

---

# Indexing or Subsetting a Vector


* `R` uses `1` based indexing.
* We use `[]` to get the value at an index

```r
x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
x[2]
```

```
## [1] 3
```
* Works with vectors of indices:

```r
x[c(2,5)]
```

```
## [1] 3 8
```
* And can get *all but* indices:

```r
x[-4]
```

```
## [1] 1 3 5 8 9
```

---

# Logical Subsetting


* One can use a vector of `TRUE` and `FALSE` to index:

```r
x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
x[c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)]
```

```
## [1] 1 3 5 8
```
* Let's create a *logical vector* for condition `x &gt; 3`

```r
x &gt; 3
```

```
## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```
* We can get all values of `x` where `x&gt;3` is `TRUE`:

```r
x[ x &gt; 3 ]
```

```
## [1] 5 7 8 9
```

---
class:inverse

#Task 2!


* From the `runif` function get 10 numbers drawn from the uniform distribution and store in `x`.

* get all the elements of `x` larger than 0.3, and store them in `y`.

* using the function `which`, store the *indices* of all of those elements in `iy`.

```
## [1]  1  2  3  4  9 10
```
* Check that `y` and `x[iy]` are identical.

```
## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
```

---

# Matrix


* A `Matrix` is a two-dimensional Array

```r
X = matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
X
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    4    7
## [2,]    2    5    8
## [3,]    3    6    9
```
* Subsetting needs two indices now:

```r
X[1,2]
```

```
## [1] 4
```

```r
X[3, ]
```

```
## [1] 3 6 9
```

---

# Matrix Operations


* Let's create two matrices.

```r
X = matrix(1:4, 2, 2)
Y = matrix(4:1, 2, 2)
```
* Arithmetic!

```r
X * Y # equally for +, - and /
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    4    6
## [2,]    6    4
```
* But `X * Y` is **not** matrix multiplication. All of above are *element by element* operations.
* Matrix multiplication uses `%*%`. What is `X %*% Y` for you?

---
class: inverse

# Task 3


* Create a vector containing `1,2,3,4,5` called v.

* Create the (2,5) matrix `m`:

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,]    1    2    3    4    5
## [2,]    6    7    8    9   10
```
* Perform matrix multiplication of `m` with `v`. Use the command `%*%`. What dimension does the output have?

```
## [1] 2 1
```
* Why does the command `v %*% m` not work?

---

#Lists


* Up to now, all containers were *homogeneous*
* `lists` are more flexible:

```r
# works with and without fieldnames
ex_list = list(
  a = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  b = TRUE,
  c = "Hello!",
  d = diag(2)
)
ex_list
```

```
## $a
## [1] 1 2 3 4
## 
## $b
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $c
## [1] "Hello!"
## 
## $d
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    0
## [2,]    0    1
```

---

# Indexing Lists


* `[]` gets a *sublist*
* `[[]]` gets a list element
* Can index by numerical index or name

```r
ex_list[1]
```

```
## $a
## [1] 1 2 3 4
```

```r
ex_list[[1]]
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4
```

```r
ex_list$d
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    0
## [2,]    0    1
```


---
class: inverse

#Task 4


1. Copy and paste the above code for `ex_list` into your R session. Remember that `list` can hold any kind of `R` object. Like...another list! So, create a new list `new_list` that has two fields: a first field called "this" with string content `"is awesome"`, and a second field called "ex_list" that contains `ex_list`.
1. Accessing members is like in a plain list, just with several layers now. Get the element `c` from `ex_list` in `new_list`!
1. Compose a new string out of the first element in `new_list`, the element under label `this`. Use the function `paste` to print the string `R is awesome` to your screen.

---

# DataFrames

`DataFrames` are like spreadsheets.


```r
example_data = data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 5, 7),
                          y = c(rep("Hello", 3), "Goodbye"),
                          z = sample(c(TRUE,FALSE),size=4,replace=TRUE))
example_data
```

```
##   x       y     z
## 1 1   Hello  TRUE
## 2 3   Hello FALSE
## 3 5   Hello  TRUE
## 4 7 Goodbye  TRUE
```

---

# DataFrames


* Useful methods for a dataframe:

```r
nrow(example_data)
```

```
## [1] 4
```

```r
ncol(example_data)
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
names(example_data)
```

```
## [1] "x" "y" "z"
```

---

# Data on Cars


* The `mtcars` dataset is built-in to `R`.

```r
head(mtcars,n=3)  # show first 3 rows
```

```
##                mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
## Mazda RX4     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
## Datsun 710    22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
```
* To access one of the variables **as a vector**, we use the `$` operator as in `mtcars$mpg`
* Or we use the column name or index: `mtcars[,"mpg"]` or `mtcars[,1]`

---

# Subsetting Data.Frames


* Subsetting is like with matrices, `[,]`

```r
# mpg[row condition, col index]
mtcars[mtcars$mpg &gt; 32, c("cyl", "disp", "wt")]
```

```
##                cyl disp    wt
## Fiat 128         4 78.7 2.200
## Toyota Corolla   4 71.1 1.835
```
* But there is a special function which looks nicer.

```r
subset(mtcars, subset = mpg &gt; 32, select = c("cyl", "disp", "wt")]
```

---
class: inverse

# Task 4


1. How many observations are there in `mtcars`?

1. How many variables?

1. What is the average value of `mpg`?

1. What is the average value of `mpg` for cars with more than 4 cylinders, i.e. with `cyl&gt;4`?

---

# Basic Programming


* It's useful for us to review some basics for programming.
* We won't be going very deep here, but it's good for you to know some of this.

---

# Variables


* A variable refers to an *object*.
* Another way to say it is that a variable is a name or a *label* for something:

```r
x = 1
y = "roses"
z = function(x){sqrt(x)}
```
* *local* variables are only defined (and hence visible) within a certain area of your code, called a *scope*
* *global* variables are defined everywhere.
* Try to **avoid global variables**.

---

# Control Flow


* We can influence which *branch* our code executes based on
* Whether we follow one branch or another depends on a `condition`.



```r
if (condition == TRUE) {
  some R code
} else {
  some other R code
}
```

---

# Example if-else




```r
x = 1
y = 3
if (x &gt; y) {  # test if x &gt; y
  # if TRUE
  z = x * y  # assign value to z
  print("x is larger than y")
} else {
  # if FALSE
  z = x + 5 * y  # assign other value to z
  print("x is less than or equal to y")
}
z
```

---

# Loops


* This is an example for a loop:

```r
for (i in 1:3){  # does not have to be 1:3!
  print(i) # loop body: gets executed each time
  # the value of i changes with each iteration
}
```

```
## [1] 1
## [1] 2
## [1] 3
```
* We can iterate over things other than numbers:

```r
for (i in c("mangos","bananas","apples")){
  print(paste("I love",i))  # the paste function pastes together strings
}
```

```
## [1] "I love mangos"
## [1] "I love bananas"
## [1] "I love apples"
```

---

# Nested Loops

We often also see *nested* loops, which are just what its name suggests:


```r
for (i in 2:3){
  # first nest: for each i
  for (j in c("mangos","bananas","apples")){
    # second nest: for each j
    print(paste("Can I get",i,j,"please?"))
  }
}
```

```
## [1] "Can I get 2 mangos please?"
## [1] "Can I get 2 bananas please?"
## [1] "Can I get 2 apples please?"
## [1] "Can I get 3 mangos please?"
## [1] "Can I get 3 bananas please?"
## [1] "Can I get 3 apples please?"
```

---

# Functions


* Function `say_hello` tells `R` what to do when it you tell it `say_hello()`.

```r
say_hello &lt;- function(your_name = "Lord Vader"){
  paste("You R most welcome,",your_name)
}
# we call the function by typing it's name with round brackets
say_hello()
```

```
## [1] "You R most welcome, Lord Vader"
```
* We specified a default argument, but we don't have to.
* Call the function with your name!

# Task 5


1. Write a for loop that counts down from 10 to 1, printing the value of the iterator to the screen.
1. Modify that loop to write "i iterations to go" where `i` is the iterator
1. Modify that loop so that each iteration takes roughly one second. You can achieve that by adding the command `Sys.sleep(1)` below the line that prints "i iterations to go".
1. Finally, let's create a function called `ticking_bomb`. it takes no arguments, it's body is the loop you wrote in the preceding question. The only think you should add to the body is a line after the loop finishes, printing "BOOOOM!" with `print("BOOOOM!")`. You can repeatedly redefine the function in the console, and try it out with `ticking_bomb()`.
